## Starting a poem

Here's some ways I've found to [[Just Start]]a poem.

-   Use [[Prompts]].
-   [[Free Writing]] and [[Write to a Timer]]
-   Write from a picture prompt ([[Ekphrastic Writing]])
-   [[Writing Exercises]]
-   [[Embrace Randomness]]
-   How are you feeling? Write around that

Then look at [[Editing A Poem]]

It's important to try to find [[Ways to Focus]].
