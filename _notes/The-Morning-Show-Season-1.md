An exploration of sexual misconduct within a fictional news shop. I found this to be incredible powerful, well acted and well written, exploring the systemic culture of silence that allowed an abuser to flourish. Everyone has various levels of complicity and things to gain from not mentioning the abuse. 

It also explores the abuse itself, how the main abuser thinks the accusations are false. Over the course of the season the lies and mistruths are stripped back to reveal the grim truth. The powerful are held to account.
