To avoid procrastinating, just start it and see how it goes. Itâ€™s generally a good rule for life but is especially useful for creative work and writing. Start a story with no idea where it's going. Start a poem using [[Prompts]]. [[Embrace Randomness]]. It can help you overcome [[Writers Block]] It's also a great way to start learning something- blunder into a subject and ask questions.

This way you allow your subconscious to take over, which can be scary. But once you've started writing you can edit, you can interrogate the little you know, you can make decisions which you wouldn't otherwise make.
