[[BookNotes]]

author: [[Jennifer-Egan]]

Direct sequel to [[A-Visit-From-The-Goon-Squad-by-Jennifer-Egan-2010]]. This follows similar and related characters through connected short stories. While the previous part was concerned with aging and society changing, this revolves around a memory capture device that is clearly influenced by social media.

While there's a lot to like about this book it didn't resonate with me as much as *A Visit From The Goon Squad*
