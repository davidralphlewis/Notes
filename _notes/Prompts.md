Write or [[Free Writing]] to a prompt. They can be anything as long as they spark off ideas. You don't necessarily need to stick to the prompt. Once you're writing, you can go off on tangents.

## Where to find prompts;

-   <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bristoltonic" >Bristol Tonic</a> is a night where poets and musicians chose a prompt and have a month to write something.
-   Write in response to a piece of art ([[Ekphrastic Writing]]).
-   Don't think, just [[Embrace Randomness]].
