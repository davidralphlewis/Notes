Haiku are small poems.   
Three lines of five, seven, five  
syllables- simple!  

Haiku are easy to explain but hard to master. They are typically themed around seasons or nature.

Itâ€™s worth noting syllables work differently in Japanese to English. I am talking about the English version.

You can build haiku into sequences, but typically they will be one off, dealing only with a single moment.

I often use haiku as a warm-up before writing something else.

- Malika Booker suggests keeping a haiku journal to improve your writing.
