A Japanese poetic form, renowned for its simplicity and focus on nature. Usually in English it is translated as three lines of 5/7/5 syllables. In Japanese this does not exactly track.

I often write them as a warm up, writing haiku as a way of [[Journaling]]. 

- [[Mailika-Booker]] suggested keeping a [[Haiku-Journal]] in ([[Red-Sky-Session-1]]) as way of practising poetry regularly and focusing on [[Specific-Detail]]
