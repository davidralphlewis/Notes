n brain makes connections between unrelated things. However, pareidolia is more concerned with random visual input.

It's why we see faces in random rock faces and bits of toast. Even this, which is just lines:

Our brains are wired to see faces so we see them everywhere. Pareidolia isn't just limited to faces though, we can see writing where there isn't any, or shapes in the clouds which don't exist.

We can't trust our sight, so its another one of our many [[Perception Problems]] .
