One of the most influential books on me was [[Austin Kleon]]'s *Show Your Work!* It was the reason I started [[Blogging]] initially and had an impact on why I eventually created this [[Digital Garden]].

The book is a manual for being visible in a digital age. Social media requires constant updating and you don't necessarily want to share your finished work, especially when magazines and publishers usually want first rights to it. So share your notes, your drafts, what's interesting to you etc.

It's a way of being able to [[Learn in Public]].
