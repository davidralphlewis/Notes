Instead of thinking [[Tools Dont Matter]] sometimes people fixate on gear, for example the type of pen a writer might use. 'If I use that pen, I can write the same as that successful author,' goes the thought.

Similar to [[Tool Fundamentalism]]. this focuses more on the physical objects, whereas fundamentalism is more focused on following the exact steps of a process.
