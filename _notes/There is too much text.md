and tender book dealing with the residents of Popisho, who all have cors, a type of magic innate to their being. It follows several different people throughout the book over one day as their lives intertwine and disaster looms. It's often surreal with some incredible images, such as a black and white beach or someone plucking butterflies out of the air and eating them. But it's always grounded in the emotions of the characters, whether it's conflicting grief or desire. Beautifully written in a Caribbean dialect, this is a stunning book.
