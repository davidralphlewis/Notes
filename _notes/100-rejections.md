This is a common exercise to [[Put Yourself Out There]] and practise [[Sending-Your-Work-Out]]. Within a year, the aim is to get 100 rejections, not acceptances. This way it shifts your mindset so you [[Embrace-Failure]]. Itâ€™s quite a large number so it pushes you to [[Apply-for-everything]]. [[Getting-Rejections]] means you might also get some published on the way.

I have never done this. The most I have aimed for in a year is 50 submissions, but may try it in the future.
