Aztec history was not a single, [[History-is-Always-Edited| edited]] view of history but was instead a multiplicity. It contained different perspectives and [[Everything-is-a-Story|stories]] of the same events, often looping back over itself to show a panoply of views.

[[History-is-Written-by-the-Winners|European conquerers overwrote]] these dense stories with a single, monolythic narrative.

- I learnt this from *<a href="https://aeon.co/essays/for-the-wanderers-who-became-the-aztecs-history-was-a-chorus-of-voices" >How Aztecs told history</a>* by Camilla Townsend, a fascinating article on Aeon.
