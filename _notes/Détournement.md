A strategy used by the Situationists in 1960s, detournement uses existing texts, images and transforms them, making the familiar strange. An example would be taking an advert and replacing the text to make it odd. 


> *DÃ©tournement* is a way of taking existing objects, words, ideas, art-works, media, etc., and using them differently so they become entirely new experiences.
