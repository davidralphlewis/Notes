#BookNotes 

An exploration of anxiety, both scientific and personal. Tim Clare suffers from extreme anxiety and panic attacks and attempts different methods in order to cure it. There is a lot of scientific research in this book where it can get a bit lost in the technical detail, but the descriptions of his personal experiments to cure himself are engaging. 

## Key Ideas

- There is no one cure for psychological illnesses and anyone who says they have one is probably lying.
- Science is built on uncertainty. So is anxiety. 
- Anxiety can be about attempting to seek control.
- Animal studies and models are ineffective for psychological illnesses as you cannot ask a mouse how it is feeling.
