This is the most important takeaway from [[Getting Things Done]] in my opinion. While doing things is all very well, you need some reflection and quite to ensure you are focusing on the right areas. That is where the weekly review comes in.

I look back at what I've done, then plan the week ahead. I try to ask myself some [[Questions for Self Reflection]] to steer myself right, and look at the week through different filters, like work or health. 

I tend to focus on immediate actions or errands to be done in the upcoming week, leaving the projects and reflection on where I'm going to the [[Monthly Review]].
