## Podcasts

-   Tim Clare's podcast *Death of 1000 Cuts* has invaluable advice.
-   *<a href="http://www.nightvalepresents.com/startwiththis" >Start with This</a>* from Welcome to Nightvale covers a large range of topics and has assignments that help kickstart writing.

## Books

-   Obligatory mention to Stephen King's *On Writing.* It's very clear and practical.
-   *Wonderbook* by Jeff Vandermeer is an excellent resource for unlocking imagination and applying it to story.
-   *The Blank Screen* by William Gallagher is very useful.
