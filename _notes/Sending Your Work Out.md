rpiece and now you want to get it published. Firstly, think about why you want it published by someone else. If it is just to get it out into the world you can just put it on your [[Blogging|website]] or social media. There's also [[Self Publishing]]. 

Typically you seek publication to home your craft and get the approval of editors and perspectives outside your social group.

It's important to [[Find Journals]] that fit you.

I have a number of submissions I aim for each year to make sure I'm getting work out there.

Be respectful of the editor's time. Follow the submissions guideline for each magazine and only submit when their window is open.

Be aware magazines get a lot of submissions and more likely than not you need to be comfortable in [[Getting Rejections]]

<a href="https://belljarblog.wordpress.com/2015/01/08/submitting-to-journals-the-jo-bell-method/" >Jo Bell's spreadsheet</a> method is a very useful framework for submissions. I've followed it for the last few years and its really made a difference to my attitude of how I submit poems and stories.
