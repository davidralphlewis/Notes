#Poeticform 

A relatively recent poetic form, this was invented by Terrence Hayes in his poem *<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/55678/the-golden-shovel" >The Golden Shovel.</a>* The end word of each line is the entirety of *We Real Cool* by Gwendolyn Brooks. Kind of a reverse acrostic.
