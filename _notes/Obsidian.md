This is the software I use to run this blog. I was using [[Tiddlywiki]], but found the html file limiting. Org-roam in [[Emacs]] was too local and didn't have a mobile element. Obsidian strike the right balance between being easy to pick up and complex when it scales. It has a pretty good mobile app and stores everything as [[Plain Text]] markdown files. 

I sync between mobile and computer using Syncthing.
