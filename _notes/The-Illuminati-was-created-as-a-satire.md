Although there was a real group called the Illuminati in the nineteenth century,  it was more of a club. The Illuminati as we know it today was actually made up in the 1960's as a satire against religions. 

It was never mean to be serious and instead was meant to be so over the top no-one could see it as realistic. ~~Hail Discordia!~~
