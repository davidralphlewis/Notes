Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but immortality is a myth. At some point, you will die. And the fun part is you have no idea when it will be. Could be tomorrow. Could be 50 years from now. I believe you only get one go, and once it's over it's over. No do-overs.

This is a reason why [[Life is Suffering]] and [[Everything Changes]].

Instead of moping, you should count yourself lucky that you get to be here at all and [[Embrace the Wonder of Being Alive.]]

>Don't behave as if you are destined to live forever. What's fated hangs over you. As long you live and while you can, become good now
