Because [[Language-is-always-a-translation-of-thoughts]], the act of writing is a form of thinking. In my creative practice, I do a lot of [[Writing-From-the-Subconscious]] so I'm never quite sure what I actually think about a subject until I start writing it down. Writing becomes an act of [[Embodied-Cognition]], an extension of our selves and our mind  into the world. 

> The magic is in the fact that writing is a transit system, which transports little electrical sparks in your synapses into things that affect shared reality.
