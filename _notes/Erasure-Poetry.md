[[Poeticform]]

Take a magazine, newspaper or other text and erase most of it to create something new. Also known as blackout poems.

I've been making erasure poetry since 2016 on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/davidralphlewis" >Instagram.</a> [[Austin-Kleon]] inspired me at first with his newspaper poems.

I start with looking for interesting words, circling them, then building up sentences from there. I tend not to have a plan, but see what is within the text. It's very subconscious, very [[Diffused-Mode]]. If two people were given the same text they would produce two very different erasure poems.

I use a lot of music review magazines as they have interesting word choices.

It's a way to [[Transform-Existing-Work]].
