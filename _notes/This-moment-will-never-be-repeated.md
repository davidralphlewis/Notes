[[Our-Lives-Are-Brief]] and [[You-Will-Die]]. Its important then to 

realise this moment you are experiencing right now can never be repeated. Even if you recreate exactly the same conditions you are in, it will not be the same as time will move on. [[Everything-Changes]] and you are no different.

- In the Japanese tea ceremony, there's a concept called one time, one meeting, saying it will never be repeated again, even with the same people.
