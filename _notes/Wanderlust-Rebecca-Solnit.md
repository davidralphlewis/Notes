-   Waking as serenity in nature is a product of the middle classes. Need safety. It's a privilege to walk without fear of bandits.

-   This freedom ended up removing the aristocracy through right to roam.

-   Similarly, it's a privilege to walk without fear of attack as a man.

-   Women who walk are often seen as sexual. Consigned to the house.

-   Walk is an analogy of a life or tells a story

-   People used to walk around mountains not up them. Dragons rumoured to live up the top.
