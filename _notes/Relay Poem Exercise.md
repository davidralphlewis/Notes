#WritingExercise 

Set yourself a [[write-to-a-timer|timer]] of 5 minutes. Write a short poem, maybe from [[Prompts]]. Then take a word or image from that. Write another poem in 5 minutes. Then repeat again, with a word or image from the second poem.

In this way you build up a linked sequence of poems very quickly, [[writing beyond thought]].

I stole this exercise from Inua Ellam's sublime book *The Actual*, where each poem is linked to the previous one.
