A missed opportunity to explore the strange, complicated history of The Beach Boys. It misses out a lot that was controversial, skims over Brian Wilson's breakdown and ignores the abuse by his psychiatrist. Doesn't go into detail about Dennis Wilson's relationship with Charles Manson and doesn't mention a lot of the drug abuse.

It's a good example of how [[History-is-Always-Edited]], especially in a short documentary format.
