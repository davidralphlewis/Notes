re your thinking should change as well. You should always try to iterate your notes, expand where points need further explanation and make things clear. 

In this way, writing is never complete but always shifting and moving. 

Lydia Davies describes a way of using a [[Writers Notebook]] that is similar, using creative notes to create new pieces. 

> Revise notes constantlyâ€”try to develop the ability to read them as though you had never seen them before, to see how well they communicate. Constant revision, whether or not you're going to "do" anything with what you've written, also teaches you to write better in the first place, when you first write something down.
