[[BookNotes]]  author: [[Martin MacInnes]]

Odd 'mystery' novel where an inspector is asked to look for a missing person, only to lose himself in a web of artifice and strange happenings. I loved it.

- Human Society is unnatural, cities make no sense.
- Everything artificial is false- restaurants, cities, corporations full of actors.
- Biology is strange. Parasites can change the personality of a person. 
- Decay is inevitable. In the end you will be consumed by the forest ([[Nature-is-an-Elder-God]])
- Dreamlike and strange. Lynchian in places, other times like Borges. Doesn't explain itself too much. Things happen and you have to figure out what they mean.
