One pitfall of [[Getting-Things-Done]] or a [[Bullet-journal]] is that if you forget to write something down you are likely to forgot it. [[It-is-Impossible-to-Capture-Everything]] after all.

The way around this is to [[make-it-easy-to-capture-quick-notes]].  Ensure you keep your journal open or have a shortcut to your task manager. Or trying doing a [[Weekly-Review]] and sweep up anything you may have forgotten.
