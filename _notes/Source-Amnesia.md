#[[Cognitive-Bias]]

We tend to remember information but forget where we heard it from.

When keeping notes, it's important to make a note of the source. That's why I've tried to add sources and quotes to these notes whenever I can. Although that said, there are a lot of notes without sources.

I've already forgotten where I found this.
