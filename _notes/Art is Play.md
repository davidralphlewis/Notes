All art is messing around. It's following hunches and playing with different parameters to get different results. It's embracing your inner child and just making something for the sake of it.

Remember that [[all art is subjective]] as well.

-   Vanessa Kissule calls poetry throwing spaghetti at a wall to see what sticks.
-   The Blindboy Podcast has an episode on messing around as feeding your inner child (wet kensignton tent)
-   I expanded this into a longer, more personal blog post <a href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/art-is-play/" >here.</a>
