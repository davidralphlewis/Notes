An eight line stanza with two rhymes throughout the whole poem. The first line is repeated in the forth and seventh line and the second line is the same as the last.

This is the structure:

Third line (rhymes with first)  
Forth line (same as the first)  
Fifth line (rhymes with second)  
Sixth line (same last word as second.)  
Seventh line (same as the first)  
Eighth line (same as second)
