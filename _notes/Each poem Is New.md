Whenever you start [[Writing Index|writing]] a new poem, it is like you have never written a poem before. Each poem is a new approach.

> Last poem and the next poem. I try to focus on that. I hope that I’m changing all the time. Constantly asking myself, how can it be different from the last? I like having something to work on. That’s how my head is. I have to do something new. Something different each time.

It can lead to [[Imposter Syndrome]] as you assume everyone else knows what they are doing every time.

[[Writing Every Day]] helps to challenge this. It also means you are growing as an artist.

It’s important to remember this and [[Focus on Process not the end goal]].
