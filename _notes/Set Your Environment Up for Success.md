This is a message to me: [[Tidy Your Space]]. Right now. 

Your environment doesn't reflect your success. Instead, it shapes it. If you live in a tidier house you will be more focused. If you have things immediately at hand, like floor, you are more likely to use them. 

In this way, the spaces you occupy the most should reflect the person you want to be. 

Remember, [[Surfaces arent Storage]]!
