Because [[Our Lives Are Brief]], we have to [[decide what is important to you]] We can't do everything, so what we chose to eliminates any other choice we might make. 

> Every decision to use a portion of time on anything represents the sacrifice of all the other ways in which you could have spent that time, but didn’t – and to willingly make that sacrifice is to take a stand, without reservation, on what matters most to you.
>[[Four Thousand Weeks-Oliver Burkeman]]

> Every choice you make, every time you prioritize one thing over another, there are corresponding sacrifices you make. Opportunity cost, certainly. But sometimes the trade-offs are financial, emotional, or relational. Whether you are willing to address those trade-offs explicitly or not is beside the point. They exist.
