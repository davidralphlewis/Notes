In order to stop procrastination, commit to something for just ten minutes. It allows you to [[Start-before-you-are-ready]]. It's low enough that it doesn't matter if you don't get any where, but more likely it will get you in the zone and you will carry on working. You [[Lower-the-Barrier-To-Entry]] .

Similar in a way to [[Pomodoro]] or starting to [[Write-to-a-Timer]].
