From Julia Cameron in her book *The Artists Way*. You write three pages in a notebook, longhand, every morning. It's meant to clear out your mind, a form of a [[brain dump]]. I've never got on with it personally, but I know some people swear by it. I prefer to [[Journaling]] and use a [[Writers Notebook]] for intermittent notes for the rest of the day.
