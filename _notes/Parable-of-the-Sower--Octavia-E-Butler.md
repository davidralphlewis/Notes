Let's read some science fiction to escape the world! Only this story is set in 2026 where climate change has ravaged the Americas. Oh. 

Powerful and hugely impactful, this is a violent, disturbing book. It's like J G Ballard but with tons more empathy. What's interesting is how the main character views the situation as a slide back, drawing parallels to horrific aspects of history like slavery or war. Recommended, but not an easy read.
## [[5-things-to-steal]]

- Effects of climate change are there but never explicitly explained.
- Hope, despite everything.
- Empathy for everyone, even those who steal and murder.
- Things falling apart fast.
- Situation and challenges overwhelming but carrying on anyway.
