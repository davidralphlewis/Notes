fe to get anything done. We live, we age fast then we die. ([[You Will Die]]).

> Out, out, brief candle!  
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,  
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,  
And then is heard no more. It is a tale  
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,  
Signifying nothing.
> -- Macbeth- William Shakespeare
