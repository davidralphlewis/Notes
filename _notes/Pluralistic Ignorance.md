This is a phenomenon where you resist speaking up because you think others agree when others actually have the same idea. For example, you might drink to excess because you think that everyone else wants to do it, whereas the majority don't actually want to.

It can be challenged by talking about it and making the norms visible.

â€“ I first came across this on an episode of *You Are Not So Smart*
