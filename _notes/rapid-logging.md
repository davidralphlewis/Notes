This is the fundemental part of the [[Bullet-journal]] system by [[Ryder-Caroll]] where you write down thoughts as and when they come to you, tagging them with different bullets to categorise them. Its similar to [[Free-Writing]] but more structured, because it allows for you to quickly examine a list and see the different types of entry.
