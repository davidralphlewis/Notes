The Humanities are not fluff subjects. English teaches you how to examine where narratives come from, how they are constructed and why ([[Everything-is-a-Story]]). It offers different perspectives on established stories. History explicitly shows you how the stories of nations are made ([[Every-nation-is-fictional]]), who gets to speak and why ([[History-is-Always-Edited]])

This is why the study of these subjects has come under attach, because people do not want narratives questioned.
