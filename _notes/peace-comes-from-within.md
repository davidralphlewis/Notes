Calmness and inner peace does not come from the external world. [[happiness-does-not-lie-in-external-validation]]. It is something you cultivate from within yourself. [[Life-is-Suffering]] but the way you react to it can develop your inner peace.

The stoics talk about the need to develop this inner peace:

>... if a person could develop peace within themselvesâ€”if they could achieve *apatheia*, as they called itâ€”then the whole world could be at war, and they could still think well, work well, and be well.
