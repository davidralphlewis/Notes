[[Tools-Dont-Matter]]. Instead, focus on creating systems that work for you. [[Obsidian]] is a great tool but it isn't a stand in for actual thinking. A good system of writing and thinking (although sometimes [[Writing-is-Thinking]]) will be supported by a tool such as Obsidian. But without a system you will not know how to use the tool.

[[look-for-a-reason-why]] you are using a tool and design a system around it.
