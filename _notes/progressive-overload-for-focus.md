[[Ways-to-Focus]]

Set a timer and measure how long you can [[focus]] on one thing. When you get distracted ([[Distraction-is-Inevitable]]) stop the timer.

Next, try to improve your focus time, even by a minute.

This is know as progressive overload,  a little bit like weight training but for your mind.

It's sort of a reverse [[Pomodoro]]
