Often in creative work we want what me make to match the glittering vision in our head. We want the poem to be perfect, we want the painting to be flawless or we want the song to be everything to everyone. 

The truth is [[Art is Always Translation]] and it will never be 'perfect'.  It will only ever be good enough. There's always something you can tweak or edit, but at some point you have to walk away and call it done.

Perfection doesn't exist. It's a myth we use to beat ourselves up about the work we create. 

The [[70 percent rule]] is a good way of overcoming perfectionism.

> Perfection is a distractionâ€”another shiny object taking your attention away from your real priorities.
