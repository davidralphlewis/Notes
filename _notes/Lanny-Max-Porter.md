[[BookNotes]] Author: [[Max-Porter]] 

Just your standard story of an ancient pagan spirit kidnapping a child, and the manhunt that ensues within the village. *Lanny* weaves and jumps to different perspectives and voices, with experimental language and strange, off-beat poetic sections. For all the experimentation however, this manages to be an emotional rich story that examines outsiders and the violence underneath English society.
