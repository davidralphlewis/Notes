Prioritise taking actions instead of spending a long time thinking about what you want to do, or considering the best path forward. [[some-action-is-better-than-no-action]] after all, so starting something and taking a few concrete actions, even if they are small is more useful. 

This helps stop the all or nothing mentality and gets you started.
