An idea from [[julia-cameron]] as a way to clear [[Writers-Block]].

First thing in the morning, write three pages longhand to empty out your brain. Don't stop moving the pen over the page. It's a form of [[Free-Writing]].

It's never really worked for me. I would prefer to spend that time making things.
