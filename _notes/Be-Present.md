It's important to be present in your life. Not living in the past, looking at regrets or decisions you have made. Or living in the future, spending too much time planning what you want to. Instead, you try and spend your attention as much as possible to the present moment. [[Attention-is-Everything]].

Things that help for me are [[Meditating|meditation]], [[Write-to-a-Timer]] and using a [[Writers-Notebook]] to [[brain-dump]].

The opposite of being present is being distracted constantly, for example on social media where it is intentionally hard to focus. Remember [[Social-Media-is-Designed-to-Capture-Our-Attention]].

Don't beat yourself up too much though, because [[Distraction-is-Inevitable]].

> Nothing lasts forever. Someday we will all be gone, perhaps even all humanity will be nothing more than a speck in the infinity of time. But in spite of these certainties and thoughts and fears and anxieties, we are still alive now, in the present, in this moment, and we should not spend so much time either clinging to the past or worrying about the future that we forget about the present.
