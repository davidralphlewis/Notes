Whilst being creative,  you should [[Focus-on-Process-not-the-end-goal]]. But you should also try to enjoy the process of creating, finding joy in the work itself. This means [[Art-is-Play]] and not too serious.

> Making art is hard! It takes a long time, you do the same things over and over, you’re a worker, you’re practicing, you’re flowing. How will you keep going if you don’t find any joy in your work?
