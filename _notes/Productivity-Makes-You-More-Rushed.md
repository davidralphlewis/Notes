Getting lots of things done means your day fills up with more tasks, most of them unwanted. It also makes you feel more stressed and more rushed. Instead, [[Slow-Down]] and allow things to take the time they take.

>[[productivity]] is a trap. Becoming more efficient just makes you more rushed, and trying to clear the decks simply makes them fill up again faster.
