We never allow ourselves to be bored any more. We have the entire history of human knowledge in our pockets, so we are constantly seeking new knowledge. In order for our creative mind to take over, we need to [[Avoid Overstimulation]] and allow our minds to wander, engaging the [[Diffused Mode]] of our brains.  It's making ourselves [[Sit With Discomfort]] in order to be more mentally healthy.
