 Speaking and writing are always incomplete compared to how we think. [[Art-is-communication]] but it is almost always translated from our thoughts. This is why [[Writing-is-Thinking]], because the act of writing something down translates it from one medium (your soft squishy electric brain) to another (hard cold ink).

In this way, the communication of any piece of writing (including this one) is always incomplete. [[There-Will-Always-Be-a-Gap-Between-Dreams-and-Reality]].
