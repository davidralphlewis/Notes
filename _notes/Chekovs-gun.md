A rule in fiction which says that if you introduce an element, that must have some impact on the story. For example, if a gun is placed on the wall, it must be fired eventually.

It's used as shorthand to describe any element that is introduced early in a story and comes back later. It also adds to the idea that everything within a story should be essential to it.
