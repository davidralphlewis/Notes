It's important to be present in your life. It's focusing on the things that matter instead of being constantly distracted.

Things that help for me are [[Meditating|meditation]], [[Write to a Timer]] and using a [[Writers Notebook]] to [[brain dump]]

The opposite of being present is being distracted constantly, for example on social media where it is intentionally hard to focus.
