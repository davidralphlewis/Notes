It's important to be present in your life. Not living in the past, looking at regrets or decisions you have made. Or living in the future, spending too much time planning what you want to. Instead, you try and spend your attention as much as possible to the present moment. [[Attention is Everything]].

Things that help for me are [[Meditating|meditation]], [[Write to a Timer]] and using a [[Writers Notebook]] to [[brain dump]].

The opposite of being present is being distracted constantly, for example on social media where it is intentionally hard to focus. Remember [[Social Media is Designed to Capture Our Attention]].

Don't beat yourself up too much though, because [[Distraction is Inevitable]].
