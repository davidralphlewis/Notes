If you are tired and stressed it may be because your have too much work to do. Self help would say you need to be organised, need to find [[Ways to Focus]], and you need to work smarter not harder. It ignores the system you are in. Maybe in this example the company needs to hire more people, but won't because of cost. That is a systemic solution that self help ignores. In this case, [[Productivity is a Plaster]].

Generally, because self help is so focused on the individual it never raises these systemic issues or finds ways to address them. It's easier to change your motivation than it is to change a whole system or society, but [[Systemic Change is Essential]].
