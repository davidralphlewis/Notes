When working creatively, remember the point is the process not the end goal. Itâ€™s the journey of discovery, the unexpected twists your mind takes along the way that is where the real joy is. 

If you focus on the end goal, your work will be restrained as you are always thinking for an audience. If you focus on the process, you are doing it for yourself and for joy. [[Art is Play]].
