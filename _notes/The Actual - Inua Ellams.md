## *The Actual* - Inua Ellams

You would expect  series of poems, all starting with "fuck" to be furious. Of course, there is rage in these poems, especially in the multi-part "Fuck// Empire", with its withering repetition and bluntly stated atrocities. But there's also joy and beauty. I love the sequencing of this collection, how one poem feeds into the next one. It's essential.
