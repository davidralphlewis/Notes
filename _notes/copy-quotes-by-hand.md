In order to retain information and understand how a writer constructs their sentences, copy them out by hand. [[the-friction-of-handwriting-is-the-point]] because it forces you to slow down and understand more closely.

> I am a big believer in copying quotes and passages from books by hand. To me, the slowness of writing by hand puts me in dialogue with the other writer’s words in a way that I wouldn’t experience if I just cut and pasted them into a Google doc.
