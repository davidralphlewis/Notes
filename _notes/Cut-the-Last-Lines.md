This is one of those writing rules like [[Show-Dont-Tell]] that gets brought up in every workshop. Basically end the poem a couple of lines before where you think it ends. This way, it is more enigmatic and less explicit.

It also works for stories- end it when everything changes, not in the aftermath.
