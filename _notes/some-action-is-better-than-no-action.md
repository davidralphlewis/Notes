If you can't do a huge amount, try doing the smallest possible thing. ([[Small-Changes-Add-Up]] after all.) This will still ensure you make progress towards your goal.

This means you [[Have-a-bias-towards-action]] and will end up doing more than you would. This also helps you stop all or nothing mentality.
