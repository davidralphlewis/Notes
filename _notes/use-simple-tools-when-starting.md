I have a personal rule, which is when I start something new, I try to do it with the most basic tools I can first. So with drawing, I just used the most basic cheap pencils I can find and see if I liked it enough to buy the charcoals etc. (not yet). 

With photography I used my phone camera until I needed more fine control, then I got myself a fancier camera. 

There's a lot of pressure to buy lots of kit for every hobby (because capitalism) so this way I can decided whether I like it or not. It also reduces friction and allows you to [[Start-before-you-are-ready]].

With writing, see [[Tools-Dont-Matter]]. Avoid [[Tool-Fetishism]]
