[[BookNotes]] 

Author: [[Caroline-O-Donaghue]]

Fine summer read, witty and drama fuelled.

Realistic flawed characters. Main two in early 20â€™s, unsure what to do in their life.

Reflection of time, recession and abortion rights restricted. Flying over to England is too expensive for some.

Story ends a little too neatly for my taste.
