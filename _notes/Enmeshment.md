Enmeshment is the process in which [[Intergenerational trauma]] is passed down to the next generation, by the actions of the parents. Some trauma your grandparents experienced could be passed down to you. For example, if your grandparents were in the war, they might be more careful with food due to rationing. Your parents might pick this up as behaviour and teach this to you.

-   I first heard about this concept on [[the-blindboy-podcast]].
