[[BookNotes]] 

Author: [[Kenneth-Goldsmith]]

Interesting, if fairly academic read, about reacting to the excess of text that surrounds us. Instead of creating new works, the writer's job is to shape and select this text into new forms. Through unoriginal work the artist reveals itself. It was interesting but like a lot of conceptual art, the idea is better than the execution. I probably wont use any of these techniques but I'm glad I read it. 

## Key Ideas

* [[There-is-too-much-text]]
* [[Copying-is-creative]]
* [[DÃ©tournement]]
* [[It-is-Impossible-to-Capture-Everything]]

## Critcisms

- Many of the pieces be describes are more interesting on a conxeptual level but less interesting in practise.
- Copying is fine and all but most fail to [[Transform-Existing-Work]].
