Take a text and chose some words within it. Look in the dictionary (or use an <a href="http://www.spoonbill.org/n+7/" >online generator</a> and replace the words with the one seven steps below it.

So this poem by W. B. Yeats:

> Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven  
>   
> Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,  
> Enwrought with golden and silver light,  
> The blue and the dim and the dark cloths  
> Of night and light and the half light,  
> I would spread the cloths under your feet:  
> But I, being poor, have only my dreams;  
> I have spread my dreams under your feet;  
> Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.  

becomes this:

> Aedh Witnesses for the Clowns of Hedgerow  
>   
> Had I the hedgerows' embroidered clowns,  
> Enwrought with golden and simulation light-year,  
> The bluff and the dim and the dartboard clowns  
> Of nightlight and light-year and the half-sister light-year,  
> I would sprinkler the clowns under your footmen:  
> But I, belle poor, have only my dressmakers;  
> I have sprinkler my dressmakers under your footmen;  
> Tread softly because you tread on my dressmakers.  

You can also use variations of this, so go n-7 (7 steps above the word) or any combination you think of. It's a great way to remove the meaning from the text and find strange new combinations.

-   I learnt this exercise in a workshop with Nikki Dudley, but I think it originates with the [[Oulipo]] constraints.
