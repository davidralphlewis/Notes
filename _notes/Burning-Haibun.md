A burning haibun is a [[Poetic-Forms]] where a [[Prose-Poem]] full of visual imagery is condensed down twice, first into
[[Erasure-Poetry]], then tranformed into a [[notes-site/haiku|haiku]]. 

It was invented by torrin a. greathouse. You can read the original poem [here. ](https://www.frontierpoetry.com/2017/06/16/poetry-burning-haibun-torrin-greathouse/)
