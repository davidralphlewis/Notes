[[Everything-Changes]]. We may have similar problems to the past but they are different in unique ways, and as such they require new solutions. Anyone who claims we can go back to the past is deluded or selling you something. Remember [[Nostalgia-is-always-false]]. 

Focus instead on a new and different solution. Combine ideas in different ways. Come up with something more suited to the times we live in.
