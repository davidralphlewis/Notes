We should always be aware that because of our [[Perception-Problems]], our [[History-is-Always-Edited]]  There's no objective series of events that has happened, instead, [[Everything-is-a-Story]]

One way it is incomplete and fragmentary is that it is always written by the winners. The winners glorify their story. They may downplay any violence they committed or demonise the ones who lost to justify their success. They may twist the story to seem like their victory was inevitable.  

Typically, we do not hear the voices or stories of those who lost.

> The defeated go down in history and disappear, and their stories die with them
