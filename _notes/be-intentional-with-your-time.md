In order to [[Choose-What-is-Important]], we need to be intentional with how we use our limited time on this earth ([[Our-Lives-Are-Brief]]). 

First, we can [[Start-with-silence]]. Then we can write down our goals.

This is the main argument of [[The-bullet-journal-method]] and [[Four-Thousand-Weeks]]

> Intentionality is the power of the mind to direct itself toward that which it finds meaningful and take action toward that end.
> [[Ryder-Caroll]]- [[The-bullet-journal-method]]
