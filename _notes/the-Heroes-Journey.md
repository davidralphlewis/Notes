Described by Joseph Campbell, he saw this as the universal monomyth. 

Someone is forced to leave home, seeks fortune, and returns changed. The original [[Star-Wars]] is a example of a film that stays explicitly to this template. 

My problem with this is it only allows one type of story to be told. It's also pretty sexist as the hero is almost always a man.
