Failure is an inevitable part of creating things, and an inevitable part of life. Instead of  being scared of it ([[Fear-of-Failure]]), it is much better to embrace failure as a process of getting better.

One way to do this is to [[Apply-for-everything]], knowing you might not get it. Or for writing try to get [[100-rejections]]. Or remember [[your-job-is-to-add-to-the-pile]]
