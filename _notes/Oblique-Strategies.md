Cards by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt that are intended to provoke you out of [[Writers-Block]]. They [[Embrace-Randomness]] and give a new aproach to a piece of work. 

Instructions may be vague (allow an easement) or specific (do the washing up.)

- There's an online version of the cards [here](https://stoney.sb.org/eno/oblique.html)
