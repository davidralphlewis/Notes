#WritingExercise


When writing, use two or three of the five senses to bring description to life. I've seen it as a tip for creative writing but also for[[Dungeons and Dragons]]. Itâ€™s a ways of using [[Specific Detail]] and grounding the world in the perception of the characters

## Exercise

Pick an object. In five sentences explain:

-   What it sees.
-   What it hears.
-   What it smells.
-   What it tastes.
-   What it feels.

Keep the detail [[Concrete or abstract|concrete]] and simple. The aim is to generate images and use the senses.

-   This writing exercise comes from a workshop with Rebecca Tanthony
