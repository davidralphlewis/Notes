Things disappeared by police, island inhabitants forget they existed

Slow erasure of everything. About inevitable entropy of living. The slow decay of everything, even the body. ([[Nothing-lasts-forever]])

Totalitarian state erodes the soul and meaning. Once it’s gone it is hard to get back.

Calendars lost means seasons and days are gone.

About dementia, the fragility of memory. How stories are all we have and even those do not last. 

 Similar to Our wives under the sea- mourning someone while they are sill alive.

Deeply sad and melancholic with an inevitability that remains disturbiung.

Each moment is precious. We shouldn’t take anything for granted.
