A concept that originates with [[Robin-Sloan]].

> Flow is the feed. It's the posts and the tweets. It's the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that reminds people you exist.
>
> Stock is the durable stuff. It's the content you produce that's as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It's what people discover via search. It's what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time.

It's a useful way to think of writing on the internet. [[Blogging]] (and these [[Digital-Garden]]notes</a>) are flow, stock is the books I've made.
