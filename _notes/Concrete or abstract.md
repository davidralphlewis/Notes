ere's broadly two types of imagery- abstract and concrete.

Abstract is conceptual, so thing like love, victory, kindness- ideas that aren't necessarily grounded in the real world.

Concrete is things you can physically feel, touch and experience. So a rose is a concrete image when love isn't. (although maybe you can[[Twist a Clich√©]] by finding a new aspect of the rose.)

Concrete imagery tends to be better  if you use more [[Specific Detail]] you use. 

A good way to focus on the concrete is to use [[The Five Senses]]
