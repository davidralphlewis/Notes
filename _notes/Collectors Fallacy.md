This is the idea that more stuff is better than small amounts of quality stuff. It's easy to run into this, especially when taking lots of [[Notes Should Be Atomic|small notes]] and setting up a [[Digital Garden]]

It is better instead to focus on small areas or notes and work with the text.

(This is almost a [[Meta Notes|meta note. ]])
