When writing, it is important  to [[make-your-language-new-and-strange]]. One way to do this is to [[Vary-sentence-length]] but it is also important to vary the syntax of the sentence, how you structure it. If you find yourself using the same patterns over and over, mix it up. Instead of:

> He walks there. He watches something important happen. He sighs and sits

Try changing the order:

> He walks there. Something important happens, so he watches. Sighs. He sits.
