If you are [[Sending Your Work Out]] regularly, there's a good chance it may be rejected.

-   Sam J. Grudgings has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRjVWzbL66o" >very good video</a> on being rejected. It sucks, but it's also an opportunity to improve.

> Turn applying for big dreams into your hobby. Like, your actual hobby, because once you get over the fear of failure, the dreaming part is fun. Spend a few hours a week looking for opportunities that would literally change your life: Jobs around the world. Massive fellowships—and small ones, too. Piss-your-pants opportunities. Make yourself available. Apply for things on a whim. Forget about them. Maybe you’ll hear back; maybe you won’t.
