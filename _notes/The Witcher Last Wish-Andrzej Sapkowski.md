#BookNotes 

-   Using mythology and fantasy tropes to question morality (Like [[Lanny-Max Porter]])
-   Relies too much on lone wolf and fantasy lore.
-   Elves as indigenous peoples, men as violent oppressors.
-   Violence is always horrific, no matter if it's justified.
-   Short stories like folklore.
