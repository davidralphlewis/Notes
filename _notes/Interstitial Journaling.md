A form of [[Journaling]]. Instead of sitting down and reflecting after the events, you rapidly log how you feel at any given time. It's a mixture of feelings and tasks For example:

-   9:01: Starting work. I need to do task a.
-   10:14: Task a completed. Been distracted.

It's useful to [[Be Present]] and think about what you need to do.

I occasionally use this at work, but it can be a distraction from actually [[Getting Things Done]]. It's especially useful in [[Org-Mode]] in [[Emacs]], where a shortcut can quickly add an entry with a timestamp.

I learnt this from <a href="https://nesslabs.com/interstitial-journaling" >Anne-Laure le Cuff.</a>
