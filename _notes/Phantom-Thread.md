Reynold Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) is obsessive about making dresses and is exacting in his routine and then falls in love with Alma.

- How not to be a creative, the film. Reynold is a 'genuis', but is also a massive dick. Reminds me of Shoppenhauer who asked his wife tk follow him silently. Routines become straightjacket not a tool.
- 'Great man' whose name is kn the building and makes clothes for royalty but business is actually run by women. His sister runs the day to day, Alma inspires and forces him out of a rut.
- Strange, co dependent relationship between Reynold and Alma. Need each other, becomes new routine.
- Beautifully, lovingly shot with an incredible score by Johnny Greenwood of [[Radiohead]]
