Review]], this is a review of what I have been doing, interrogating it and then setting goals and projects for the next month. 

Unlike a [[Weekly Review]] which tends to focus on the immediate tasks that need to be done, I tend to look more at the big picture each month. I look at what projects I'm doing, what I would like to get done by the ned of the month, what I'm giving my attention to.  It takes a bit longer because of this but it pays back in more focused attention for the month.

Here are some useful [[Monthly%20review%20questions]].
