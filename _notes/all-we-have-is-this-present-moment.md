Often we get caught up in the worrying about things we have done in the past. Or we worry about what may happen in the future. But neither are useful. Instead, all we have is the present moment.

Remember [[This-moment-will-never-be-repeated]]. [[Be-Present]] and [[focus-on-what-is-in-immediately-in-front-of-you]]

> You’re _always_ only here and now, so that for a problem to exist, it must exist, in some sense, here and now. As for telling myself I only needed to do the very next thing… you always only _can_ do the very next thing, then the next, whether you like it or not.
