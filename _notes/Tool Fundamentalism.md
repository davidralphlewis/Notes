When using a tool or method, some people insist that you have to follow every method to the letter instead of finding what works for you. I've noticed it when researching [[Getting Things Done]] and [[Zettlekasten]], where people insist you aren't doing it right if you change or adapt methods.

The opposite view is [[Tools Dont Matter]].
