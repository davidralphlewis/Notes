#BookNotes 

-   Surreal and funny stream of consciousness reflecting the disjointed and strange nature of social media in the middle of [[Context Collapse]].
-   Like *Solutions and Other Problems* it starts hilarious then broadsides you halfway through with personal tragedy.
-   A reminder that life is ultimately not about being online. [[Disconnect Frequently]] and [[Be Present]], you cannot live on the internet.
