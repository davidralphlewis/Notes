]]s set at the same house party. Each poem responds to a [[Sonnet]] by Shakespeare, sometimes commenting on the language used, sometimes following a theme to it's often absurd conclusion. I loved the playfulness of this collection and the surreal nature of the poems. Kennard threads the party with recurring characters and motifs that come back. I've never read a book that is so interwoven into another either.

## [[5 things to steal]]

- Taking the concept of the [[After poem]] to the extreme, where you have to read the [[sonnet]] before the prose poem.
- Be surreal and achingly emotionally vulnerable, often within the same poem.
- An excellent example of [[Constrained Writing]], where the limitations imposed on the collection expand its scope, not lessen it. 
- Blurring the line between reality and conceit.
- Clear emotional trajectory that maps to the house party.
