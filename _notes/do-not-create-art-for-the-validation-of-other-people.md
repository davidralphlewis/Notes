When you make art, you should avoid making it for the validation or approval of an audience. Doing so will impoverish the art as you will constantly be second guessing what other people want and not focusing on what you want.

Remember,  [[The creator owes the audience nothing]]. Instead [[Embrace-Your-Weird]] and [[Focus-on-Process-not-the-end-goal]]
