After the black death swept across Europe, people starting dancing and then didn't stop. Some people danced themselves to death. These were known as the dancing plagues.

[[Blindboy-Boatclub]] argues this was a trauma response The black death was such an extreme pandemic that wiped out a large portion of the country,  so people danced as a form of PTSD.
