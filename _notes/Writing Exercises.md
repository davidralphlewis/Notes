writing, in reality most of the decisions we make are entirely subconscious. We make small decisions based on what we have seen before (because we [[Copy to Understand the Rules]]). A word may have associations that we don't realise consciously that may guide us, or we may be drawn to stories that have different resonances to us. 

[[Writing is Thinking]] because in the process we may dredge up something new from the subconscious. 

I see it as a boat on a vast ocean, casting out nets into the depths and seeing what comes up.

> Writing requires the use of the whole mind, both its sober, logical, sequential half and its savage twin: unconscious, instinctive, libidinal, maybe extrasensory. You can write something perfectly decent with only the use of the first, but without the second you will never achieve transcendence.
