In order to find your optimal [[Creative-Routine]], change where and when you write. Move to a different room. Write in the kiving room, the kitchen. See what different spaces do for your writing.

Similarly, try different times. Write first thing in the mornjng or last thing at night. The aim is to [[maximise-your-writing-time]].
