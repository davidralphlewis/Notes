[[Writing-Exercise]] [[Journaling]]

Once a day, try to write a vivid description of one moment. Focus on [[The-Five-Senses]] and try to get as much [[Specific-Detail]] as possible.

This writing exercise forces you to focus and be specific as much as possible. I try to do this as much as possible, usually writing a paragraph or so. Sometimes, from these details, a poem or longer piece of writing emerges. But you shouldn't focus on writing a longer piece. Instead, use it to [[Observe-the-world]] around you.

The [[observation-journal]] is another way to approach this, as is [[Tiny-observations]].
