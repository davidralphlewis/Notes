[[BookNotes]]

I appreciated some of the central findings of this book, like how to implement better habits, but its not much spread thin over the pages. Something about the hustle bro tone of the book really rubs me up the wrong way as well. I wish I'd just read a summary instead.

## Key Ideas

 * [[Small-Changes-Add-Up]]
 * [[Lower-the-Barrier-To-Entry]]
 * [[Set-Your-Environment-Up-for-Success]]


## Criticisms
 
-  [[Self-Help-Ignores-Systemic-Solutions]]
- No examination of why someone may find it harder to implement habits. Assumes you are healthy, neurotypical and have nothing else going on in your life.
