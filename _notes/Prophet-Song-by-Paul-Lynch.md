[[BookNotes]] 
author: [[Paul-Lynch]]

A powerful exploration of how facism can  overtake a country. Feels claustrophobic and tense throughout, with a couple of really shocking moments. Think its a powerful plea for empathy with refugees when we need it most.


- Fascism can happy anywhere. Anyone can become a refugee. 
- Long. close interior paragraphs  puts you almost in the head of Eilish but held at a distance.
- Eilish is in denial of the situation, stays within the warzone, wanting her husband and son to come back. 
- Feels claustrophobic and tense throughout, with a couple of really shocking moments. 
- The details of the situation are left vague, with the focus on the day to day survival instead. The main character isn't sure so we never are. 
- State and laws are agreed upon fictions that can be taken away without warning. 
- No happy ending, no release.
- A powerful plea for empathy with refugees when we need it most.

> History is a silent record of people who could not leave, it is a record of those who did not have a choice, you cannot leave when you have nowhere to go and have not the means to go there, you cannot leave when your children cannot get a passport, cannot go when your feet are rooted in the earth and to leave means tearing off your feet.
