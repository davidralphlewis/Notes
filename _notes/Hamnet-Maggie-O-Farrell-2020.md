Author: [[Maggie-O-Farrell]]
Went into this thinking I didnâ€™t need another book about Shakespeare, but its not really, its about Agnes and the children. Its also about being human and flawed and trying to cope with grief. Absolutely stunning, vivid and emotional writing that drags you into the interior of Agnes' life and grief. Also highlights just how much the lives of historical women have been overlooked. Loved it.
