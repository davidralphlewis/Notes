# First Draft

A first draft is a rough bash of a piece of writing. Unlike the [[0th Draft]], you know what you want to write about. You might even have a vague idea of the points you want to cover and the structure of the piece. The first draft is not about making the writing perfect, it is about getting the words down so you can set about [[Editing-A-Poem|editing]]them later.

> The first draft of anything is shit. â€” Ernest Hemingway (probably apocryphal)
