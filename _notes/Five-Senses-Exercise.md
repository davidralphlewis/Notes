# Five Senses Exercise

Pick an object. In five sentences explain:

-   What it sees.
-   What it hears.
-   What it smells.
-   What it tastes.
-   What it feels.

Keep the detail [[Concrete-or-abstract|concrete]] and simple. The aim is to generate images and use the senses.

-   This writing exercise comes from a workshop with Rebecca Tanthony
