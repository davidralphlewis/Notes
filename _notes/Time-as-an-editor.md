When you write something, put it in a drawer for a little bit so you can look at it objectively. You will lose the initial love of it, see what works and what doesn't.

I started writing in [[Writers-Notebook]] then leaving them aside for a few months before [[Editing-A-Poem|editing]] and typing up. I've found it is more useful and I write better poems.
