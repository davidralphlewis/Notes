In order to live in the present, you have to accept you are limited in what you chose to do. [[Our-Lives-Are-Brief]] and [[Any-Decision-Eliminates-Others]].  [[You-Will-Die]] and your life is short. [[We-Deny-Our-Limitations]], whereas we should accept and acknowledge them. [[Sit-With-Discomfort]].

> But I'm aware of no other time management technique that's half as effective as just facing the way things truly are.
