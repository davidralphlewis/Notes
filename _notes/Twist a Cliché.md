#WritingExercise 

Start with a cliché such as 'raining cats and dogs' and write a poem that twists it in a way.

-   This is a useful [[Writing Exercises|writing exercise]] that I first found in *Write Poetry And Get It Published* by Matthew Sweeney and John Hartley Williams.
-   This exercise was the start of <a href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/the-early-bird/" >this poem</a> I wrote.
