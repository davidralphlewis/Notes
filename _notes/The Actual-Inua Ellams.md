#BookNotes 

-   Poetry collection dealing with race, colonialism and history. It's lyrical, angry and funny in places as well.
-   All of the poems start with "Fuck". (hence the title) For example *Fuck/[[The Mandela Effect]]*. Ellams finds variety and different emotions in this one word, sometimes angry, sometimes resolute and sometimes joyful.
-   All the poems are linked together by subject or word, with one poem picking up on a phrase in the last poem or being related in some way. (This made me come up with the [[Relay Poem Exercise]])
-   It's a great example of using [[Constrained Writing]] to free up your writing.
