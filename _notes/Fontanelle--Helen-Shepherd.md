## *Fontanelle*- Helen Shepherd

It's lovely when people you know release books. Helen is a stalwart of the Bristol poetry scene, having run an open mic night called Satellite of Love for years. Her debut collection is a deeply personal look at birth and life. Helen writes beautifully about her work as a midwife, family history and even poems about the future.

We'll leave the reflecting there for now. I was going to write another blog post about films but it would just be me banging on about *The Green Knight* [again.](https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/uncertain-art/) This year I am going to try and write little summaries like this more regularly, so I don't leave it as a reflection exercise in January.
