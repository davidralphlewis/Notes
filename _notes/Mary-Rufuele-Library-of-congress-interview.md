[[source-notes]] on [this video](https://youtu.be/J3K9oMWOI_Q?si=11heRcA9YJsGEBu3) with [[Mary-Ruefle]]

-   Poetry can be enjoyed and not analysed. You don't need to know what's going on ([[Anaxa]]])
-   Poetry is paying attention. Observation. People pay attention to different things. ([[Attention-is-Everything]])
-   No computer- chose what to pay attention to.
-   will add anything to a poem.
