In order to stop procrastination, commit to something for just ten minutes. It allows you to [[Just Start]]. It's low enough that it doesn't matter if you don't get any where, but more likely it will get you in the zone and you will carry on working. You [[Lower the Barrier To Entry]] .

Similar in a way to [[Pomodoro]]Pomodoro</a> or starting to [[Write to a Timer]].
