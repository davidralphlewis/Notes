 [[Twitter]]and Facebook are free because they capture our attention. I have spend hours on [[Twitter]], not doing anything but refreshing the feed. They are designed by psychologists to be addictive and to solicit high level emotions like anger in order to keep you on the platform. The more they can keep you there, the more adverts they can serve you. 

Remember [[If-Something-is-Free-You-Are-the-Product]] and your [[Attention-is-Everything]].

>  It's because our time and attention are so limited, and therefore valuable, that social media companies are incentivised to grab as much of them as they can, by any means necessary
