I have self published a few books over the years, *Amber Stars*, *Remain Vigilant* and *Refraction*.

## Why

Think about why you want to publish something.

## Books

You can do it through Amazon KDP fairly easily but because of morals I would prefer to use a print on demand supplier.

Always get a test copy before you put it on sale. Errors that are easy to overlook on your screen will be glaringly obvious in physical print.

## E-books

Make a pdf and convert using <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/" >calibre</a>. The main formats you need are ePub and Mobi.
