Ah the good old days. Remember how good they were? Not like now.

Nostalgia is always a lie because it underplays the complexity of a previous time and ignores all the difficult elements of it. In addition, it presents the modern day as solely bad, a fallen age. The reality is always more complex than this. [[Everything-is-a-Story]] and an idealised past is no exception.
