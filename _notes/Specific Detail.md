When writing poetry or prose, it is enhanced by the use of specific detail. So instead of a 'water in a glass' you can say 'the pint glass was half full of brackish water' and it makes a much more vivid image in the reader's mind. It helps enhance the [[Concrete or abstract|concrete]] of the image. It also helps you [[Show Dont Tell]].

However, it is possible to get too lost in the detail. It's a balance, as you can end up describing too much. You have to select which details are relevant. It's better to select a handful of vivid, relevant details than to waffle too much. A good way of focusing on this is to focus on [[The Five Senses]].
