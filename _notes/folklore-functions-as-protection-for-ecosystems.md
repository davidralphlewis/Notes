This is a theory by [[Blindboy-Boatclub]] that folklore is often used as cautionary tales that protect the ecosystem. An example he gives is of the Irish myth of bees belonging to the otherworld, meaning they shouldn't be messed with. This then protects bees within the ecosystem as important pollinators

Adds to the theory that [[Everything-is-a-Story]]
