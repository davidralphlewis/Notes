This site ~~is~~ used to be written using <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com" >TiddlyWiki,</a> which is a personal wiki software that is free and open source. It's elegant, easy to use and allows me to edit the files anywhere. Most importantly, it provides the links down the bottom (using a plugin called Stroll) so you can navigate the site easier and updates any links if I change them. It allows me to keep my notes in a [[Network Better Than Linear|network]] and prioritises [[Notes Should Be Atomic|atomic notes]]. 

While I was using Tiddlywiki. I used<a href="https://www.didaxy.com/exporting-static-sites-from-tiddlywiki" >this</a> tutorial and <a href="https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-tiddlywiki" >this one</a> to publish it to a website. It was slightly too complex for my workflow.

Instead, I switched to [[Obsidian]], which is like Tiddlywiki but for the modern age. It is better on mobile, which is important for me, but also keeps every note as [[Plain Text]], meaning I can export it easily to other platforms. Tiddlywiki kept all the notes in a single html file, which was hard to export from.

 Another advantage of [[Obsidian]] is I can input the markdown files straight into  [[Jekyll]] It spits out html files with minimal input, leaving me to focus on the actual work.

-   <a href="https://groktiddlywiki.com/read/" >Grok Tiddlywiki</a> is an incredible useful guide to using Tiddlywiki, within Tiddlywiki itself
