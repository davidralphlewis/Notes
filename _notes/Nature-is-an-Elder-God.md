I noticed this in a couple of books, most noticeably *Annihilation* by [[Jeff-Vandermeer]] and [[Ness-by-Robert-Macfarlane-and-Stanley-Donwood-2019]]. Nature in these books is not placid or peaceful, but vengeful and unknowable. It does not follow the rules of human society  and is difficult to comprehend fully, so becomes something close to an elder god.
