[[BookNotes]] author: [[emily-st-john-mandel]]

A time travel novel reminiscent of cloud atlas. It's a clockwork novel, where all the pieces fit together perfectly. The time traveller is human, wanting to mess with the timeline to save people he meets from inevitable death. It's a compassionate, humanistic view of the world that I haven't seen in too much media. 

It explores the simulation theory of the universe in an eloquent and beautiful way, with a glitch that shatters the understand of the world we live in.

It's also a covid novel, exploring the impact of a pandemic on people.
