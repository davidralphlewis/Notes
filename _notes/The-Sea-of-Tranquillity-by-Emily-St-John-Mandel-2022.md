Time travel book reminiscent of cloud atlas.

Clockwork novel, fits together perfectly.

Simulation theory of the world, eloquently and beautifully elaborated on.

Glitch like a computer program.

Panic and fear of pandemic.

Time traveller as human, wanting to mess with the timeline to save people you meet from inevitable death.

Montage effect of short characters
