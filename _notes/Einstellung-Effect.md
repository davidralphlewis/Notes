The Einstellung Effect is the product of too much [[Focused-Mode]] and not enough [[Diffused-Mode]]. It means you get locked into a particular solution and are unable to see other ways of doing things, even if the other ways may be more useful. It's a narrowing of creativity in order to create a mechanised state of mind.

[[Red-Teaming]] is one way to escape this.
