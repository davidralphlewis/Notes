Increasingly,  Iâ€™ve come to realise all the poems and half baked stories in my [[Writers-Notebook]] and typed up into [[Emacs]] do not matter.  While they are part of the [[Creative-Routine]],  it does not count to the wider world unless it is public. 

The idle thoughts in my notebook will die with me so therefore the goal is to publish as much as possible. Its why I made these notes public. 

[[Open-Mics]] are another way of making writing public.
