#Poeticform 

A lipogram is constrained form of writing where intentionally avoid using a letter in the alphabet. The restraint is hard to pull off but can be immensely satisfying. Used a lot by the [[Oulipo]] group.

-   George Perec's novel *La Disparition* or *A Void* is a novel where the letter 'e' is omitted.
