Similiar to [[Free-Writing]] or [[Morning-Pages]] but somehow even less structured, this is a technique where you write down everything and anything that comes to mind. You dont have to set a time limit or gwt to a certain length of pages.

Very similiar to [[rapid-logging]], this means [[writing-down-thought-leads-to-clarity]]
