Big tasks can be overwhelming so it is important to break them down into small steps to find [[Ways-to-Focus]]. You can break them down into tiny steps so they become easy. The wah to get fit for example is one push up. 

The idea is to [[Lower-the-Barrier-To-Entry]] enough so it becomes easier to [[Just-Start]] rather than not doing it. Remember [[Small-Changes-Add-Up]]
