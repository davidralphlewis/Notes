[[film-notes]]

Documentary exploring the KLF, their legacy and the myths surrounding the house music/ art experiment. Obviously, [[Alan-Moore]] was involved. 

Claims to have 'lost tapes' from the members but never explained where these are from. The band then denied any knowledge of it. 

Heavily influenced by Discordianism and the *Illuminatus!* trilogy, especially blurring the line between reality and fiction. They burnt a million pounds and were never quite sure why. 

The band seemed more interested in process than the end result, and often had an improvisational approach to their work. 

Similar to *The Sparks Brothers* documentary, as its more interested in the story than the reality.
