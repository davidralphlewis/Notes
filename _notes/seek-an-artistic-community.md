Don't create in a vacuum. Find a community of other artists to bounce off, be inspired by and collaborate with.

This could be [[Open-Mics]] if you are a writer, a class if you are an artist or a jam session if you are a musician. Or you could [[Be-Interdisciplinary]] and seek collaboration accross mediums. 

> If youâ€™re serious about being a writer or an artist, you have to find some measure of community support. This will make it easier and more fun to do the work, and, crucially, _it will make the work better_. [Mason Currey](https://masoncurrey.substack.com/p/worm-school-week-three)
