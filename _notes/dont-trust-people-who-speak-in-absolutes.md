[[no-one-has-all-the-answers]]. Therefore, if someone is trying to sell you a miracle cure or says they are 100% right or their opponents are 100% wrong, you should probably massively distrust them. They are likely trying to sell you something or get something from you.

Common absolutes include right or wrong, good or evil or powerful and weak. They are all frameworks with nothing to back them up. [[real-intellectualism-is-humble]].
