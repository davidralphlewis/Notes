[[Red-Sky-Session]] No 2 with [[Jacob-Samuel-Rose]] on [[Poetic-Forms]]

## What is Form?

- [[Poetic-Forms are rulesets that have been refined over years]] that have been designed and codified over the years
- Rhythmic patterning and metre
- Stanza length and line length
[[poetic Form works differently in other languages]]
- 

## [[Poetic Form Does not Equal Structure]]

-   Structure is the way a poem's thinking moves
-   Eg. A turn is a shift in trajectory.

## Form Can Open Things up by Constraint.

- A way to use [[Constrained-Writing]] to free your imagination. [

## Form Can Be a Layer of Meaning.

- [[Form-Reflects-Content]]

## Try Attempting Form in Stages.

-   Eg  for a [[Sonnet]] start with 14 lines, then add in Iambic pentameter, then add in the rhyme scheme

## Inhabit a Form for a While. Live in it and See what it Does.

## Novel Forms Are Unique Takes on Constrained Thinking.

- Eg. [[Golden-Shovel]].
- Offer them for others

## [[Read-Widely]], Pay Attention to what Others Are Doing.

## Leda & the Swan- Jaqueline Saphra

-   Traditional form of white man. Twists it and makes it her own
-   Rejection of traditional [[Sonnet]] form.
-   Refuses to look away. Violence is not glamorised.

## Rewrite Same Poem in Different Forms.
