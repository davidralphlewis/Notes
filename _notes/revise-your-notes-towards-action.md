[[Meta-Notes]]

Rewrite the raw notes you make in your [[Bullet-journal]] or on scraps of paper to turn them into actionable items. Ask yourself [[does-this-serve-me]] and what can I make from it? Is it emotional, productive or creative? 

In other words, turn fleeting thoughts into products. [[notes-should-have-an-end-product]] and this helps you achieve that.

This idea is from [[Anna Havron]].
