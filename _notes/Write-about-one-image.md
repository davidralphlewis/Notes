A way of [[Starting-a-Poem]], or [[Editing-A-Poem]]. Instead of a scattershot approach of differing images throughout a poem, try focusing a describing one image in detail. The different associations with one image are a good jumping off point as [[Less-is-more]]

Another approach is to [[Write-about-one-emotion]].
