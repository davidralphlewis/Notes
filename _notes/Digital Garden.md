A digital garden is a bit less than a [[Blogging]], a bit more public than a [[writers-notebook]]. It's a collection of seeds that I tend to and develop. It's a collection of notes on various topics,, not ordered by date but in a [[Network Better Than Linear]] . This site was inspired by <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes" >Andy Matuschack's</a> notes as well as other sites where you can get lost for hours.

-   <a href="https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/" >Amy Hoy</a> argues against chronological blog format (I still like having my blog in date format as it provides a history of my thinking.)
-   <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/" >Tom Critchlow</a> has an excellent post on the idea, as does Ann- Marie Cuff.
-   <a href="https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden" >Joel Hooks</a>:

> Like with real gardens, our digital gardens are a constant ebb and flow towards entropy.  
>   
> Weeds take over. Left untended the Earth will reclaim what belongs to it.  
>   
> The same is true for our digital gardens here on the internet.
