## Starting a poem

Here's some ways I've found to [[Start-before-you-are-ready]]a poem.

-   Use [[Prompts]].
-   [[Free-Writing]] and [[Write-to-a-Timer]]
-   Write from a picture prompt ([[Ekphrastic-Writing]])
-   [[Writing-Exercise]]
-   [[Embrace-Randomness]]
-   How are you feeling? Write around that

Then look at [[Editing-A-Poem]]

It's important to try to find [[Ways-to-Focus]].
