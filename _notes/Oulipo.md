Oulipo was a group of French writers and mathematicians in the 1960's who worked from restraints, creating [[Constrained-Writing]]. Famous examples include George Perec's novel *La Disparition* where he didn't use the letter e.

Here's a few techniques they used:

-   [[n7]]

-   [[Snowball]]
-   [[Prisoners-Constraint]]
