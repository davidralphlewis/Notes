When working on a task, you should [[Reduce-distractions]]  in order to [[Focus]]. One way to do this is to expand a window so it is full screen. In this way, you [[Single-Task-Not-Multitask]].

This idea is from Leo Babuta in [Zen habits](https://zenhabits.net/full-screen/), who uses this metaphor to discuss single tasking.
