# *Circe*- Madeline Miller

-   Retelling myths from female, outsider perspective. Similiar in this way to *The Penelopiad* by Margaret Atwood or *The Silence of the Girls* by Pat Barker.
-   Power of empathy instead of seeking fame or political power.
-   The patriarchal and cruel society of Olympian gods is reflected in Odysseys and the mortals.
-   Questions whether heroes of myth were actually heroic. It's an example of how [[History is Written by the Winners]].
