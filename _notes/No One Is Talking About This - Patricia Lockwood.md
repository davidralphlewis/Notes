out This* - Patricia Lockwood

Similar to [[Solutions or Other Problems-Allie Brosh]], in this book Patricia Lockwood is laugh out loud funny in one section, then in the second half it becomes sadder and quieter. Written in a series of tweet style small paragraphs, this is a book that perfectly captures the whiplash and strangeness of being on social media. I've never read a book that is so intently a product of the internet age that manages to critique it at the same time.
