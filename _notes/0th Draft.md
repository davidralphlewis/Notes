## 0th Draft

Before you sit down to write a [[First Draft]], you need a sense of what you're going to write about. But what if you've got no idea? That's where the 0th draft comes in. It's exploratory writing that doesn't matter, [[Free Writing]] . You know you are going to throw it away. It's a draft before you actually start the main project, so it counts a draft 0. It's following every blind alley to see where they are going to end up. It's writing to find out what you want to write about.
