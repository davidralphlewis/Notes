When [[Journaling]] it is important to be completely honest with what you are writing and not to hold anything back. Write as if no one else will ever read it, as if it is a trusted friend. [[journaling-helps-you-examine-your-emotions]] so it is important not to hold back.

Remember [[Writing-is-Thinking]] and [[Writing-is-a-way-of-externalising-our-thoughts]] so it is important to be honest so you can examine your thoughts.
