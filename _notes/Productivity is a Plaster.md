Productivity can help you think clearer, but it is often used as a plaster instead of applying systemic change.

The focus is on the individual to change, rather than the whole system is rotten. For example, you can apply all the productivity systems you want but if there is too much work to do in your job then you will be stressed. [[Self Help Ignores Systemic Solutions]].

> In this context, the shortcomings of personal-productivity systems like [[Getting Things Done]]G.T.D.</a> become clear. They don’t directly address the fundamental problem: the insidiously haphazard way that work unfolds at the organizational level. They only help individuals cope with its effects.
