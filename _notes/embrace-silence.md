We fill every moment with noise, from podcasts to music. No wonder then that we are distracted and frantic.

Instead, we need to embrace silence and quiet, even if it is uncomfortable.  [[Meditating]] is one way to do this. It helps you [[Be-Present]]. It will help you hear your own thoughts



> All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone/
