t. You cannot control everything but because [[our minds are problem solvers]], you go into overdrive attempting to control future outcomes. You put plans in place for things that might not happen. In reality, we cannot control the future, so worry becomes a fraying of a knot. 

> Worry, at its core, is the repetitious experience of a mind attempting to generate a feeling of security about the future, failing, then trying again and again and again â€“ as if the very effort of worrying might somehow help forestall disaster.
