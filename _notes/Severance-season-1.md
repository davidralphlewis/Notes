[[TV-Show-Notes]]

This is a gloriously absurd and unsettling series that explores corporate horror and existential threats, with compelling, interesting characters and a richly detailed world.

Dealing with employees for a mysterious corporation called Lumen who have had their brain split in two, it leans into horror. The employees at work are trapped and unable to escape, whereas the 'outies' have lost a part of their day. 

I loved the detail of the world, the absurdity ([[horror-is-close-to-comedy]]) and the tension throughout, as well as the corporation as cult vibes throughout.
