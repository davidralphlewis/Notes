Because [[Nothing-lasts-forever]] and [[You-Will-Die]], it can be tempting to think there is no meaning in the world. But we are meaning machines, we find our own meaning in the world. It can be a project to crrate something, or it can be as simole as to try to [[Be-Kind]]. Either way , we create our own meaning.
