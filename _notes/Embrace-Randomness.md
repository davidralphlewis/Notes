If you are looking for to use [[Prompts]], try using random words and images to generate thoughts. Lots of these work best if you [[Write-to-a-Timer]], even if it's arbitrary. 

-   Use a <a href="https://randomwordgenerator.com/" >random word generator</a> and work off two or three of the generated words.
-   Generate a random image and do some [[Ekphrastic-Writing]]. (<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/random" >Unsplash</a> is good for this)
-   Open a book to a random page. Use a sentence or phrase as the first line for your writing (aka [[bibliomancy]])

You can also use randomness for editing. *[[n7]]* is a technique that embraces the change and the unusual.  [[Oblique-Strategies]] are a way to embrace different directions.
