## Collaboration with [[Adam-Kammerling]].
-   A challenge
-   Cross pollination of ideas
-   Break out of practice
-   Serve each other's art
-   Anything is possible
-   It's good to be bad at something

## Hollistic practice
Take inspiration from other places ([[Be-Interdisciplinary]])

## Challenge your default voices
For example the poetry voice, your unconscious groove. Ways of making that come easily, can lead to stagnation. Collaborations breaks us out of it.

## Stop us talking. Requires us to listen and be quiet, still.
-   What tone or mood and feeling are they giving off?
-   Can you work against it? Should you?
-   Do you give space? Do you talk more or less?
-   Rhythmic Delivery?
-   Should there even be words?
-   Do you echo or transpose it into your own words?
-   What grabs you?
-   Is there change?
-

## Being vulnerable and responsive.

## Can unlock new ways of performance.
