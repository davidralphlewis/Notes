[[BookNotes]] author: [[Sequoia-Nagamatu]]

Linked series of stories set after a global pandemic ravages the earth. All the stories have a mournful, melancholy tone as the characters attempt to grapple with the huge amount of loss. Death becomes a central part of society, with funeral houses collecting money.

I would have liked to have seen more of a variation in protagonist and tine, but the ideas and the way it links together are fascinating.
