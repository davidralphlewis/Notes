Instead of not trying anything, apply for everything. You have to enter to be considered so apply for anything you want- jobs, competitions etc. If you are an artist, chose to spend time [[Sending-Your-Work-Out]]. 

You might be [[Getting-Rejections]] but it may turn out positive.

> Turn applying for big dreams into your hobby. Like, your actual hobby, because once you get over the [[Fear-of-Failure]], the dreaming part is fun. Spend a few hours a week looking for opportunities that would literally change your life: Jobs around the world. Massive fellowships—and small ones, too. Piss-your-pants opportunities. Make yourself available. Apply for things on a whim. Forget about them. Maybe you'll hear back; maybe you won't.
