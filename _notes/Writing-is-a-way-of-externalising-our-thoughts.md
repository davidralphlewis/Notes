Writing is a way of externalising your thoughts and making them clear. Often we get lost in our own heads and tell ourselves stories of how we are. By writing these thoughts down, we can evaluate them critically, but also challenge or reorder them. We can remove the thoughts to our [[Extended-Mind]] so we don't have to deal with them.
