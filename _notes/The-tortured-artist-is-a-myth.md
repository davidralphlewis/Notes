Every film would have you believe that artists are all alcholics who suffer for their art. While this was certainly true for a lot of people in history, it does not have to be the case. Instead, it is better to [[Create-from-a-place-of-stillness-and-stability]]. 

Remember [[Art-is-Play]] and [[Art-is-a-gift]]. It doesn't have to be a torture to make things and probably shouldn't be. It can be fun instead, and often this leads to better art.
