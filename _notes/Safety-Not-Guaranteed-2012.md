Fun, quirky little film about someone building a time machine. Has the same structure as *Close Encounters of the Third Kind*, in that it's possible the main character is having a psychotic break until the closing moments. 

It's a film about regrets and living too much in the past. The characters learn to live in the present, to see each other as they are.
