A series of poems that merge Super Mario World with the story of the author's mother being treated for, and ultimately passing from cancer. It's a beautiful collection where each poem takes the title from a Super Mario stage. Contrasting the virtual world with the physical one is beautiful, and Sexton's control and play with language is beautiful. It's really interesting to see a whole collection of poems taking inspiration from video games and is something I hope we see more of. 

## [[5 things to steal]]

- Lifting structures from existing places
- Playing with words
- Finding unusual metaphors and digging down into them.
- [[Ekphrastic Writing]] that isn't just responding to visual art but other places.
- Finding moments of joy despite sorrow.
