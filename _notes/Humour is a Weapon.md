l. Although it can seem irrelevant, it is often impactful to suck the seriousness out of any sacred cow, to hold a mirror up to our inherent ridiculousness of human beings. It shatters solemnity.

It can be used to mock those who think themselves above everyone else, like fascists. Look at Nigel Farage being covered in a milkshake for example, or Charlie Chaplin's *The Great Dictator.*

Some of the best writers, like [[Kurt Vonnegut]], use humour to undermine the pomposity of humanity. Humour becomes a weapon of satire.
