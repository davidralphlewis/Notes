t feedback is through performing it. I fell into reading my poetry at [[open mics]] a few years ago and fell in love with it.

There's a few different options. [[Open Mics]]and [[slams]]slams</a> are live options, but there's also performing your poetry to youtube or making poetry videos.

It's worth mentioning that performing your work is a separate skill to writing and one that needs just as much work.
