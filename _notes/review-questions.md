Questions to help with your [[Weekly-Review]] or [[Monthly-Review]]

- How are you? Really?
- If feeling bad, what can you do to change your mood? ([[techniques to help yourself process emotions]])
- What went well?
- What didn't?
- What do I want to start doing?
- What do I want to stop doing?
- What do I want to keep doing?
- Is it still important?

Look at your [[Personal Framework]]

- Did I live my values?
- How can I change?
- Are my values still accurate?
