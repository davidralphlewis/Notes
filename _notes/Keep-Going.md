[[BookNotes]] Author: [[Austin Kleon]]

A short book full of wise, useful advice about how to keep a creative practise going. It pairs well with [[Four-Thousand-Weeks-by-Oliver-Burkeman-2021]], being concerned with mortality and the choices we make. It also makes the case that the main purpose of art lies in the creation not in external judgement, that you make things to improve yourself, not to be judged. Nothing in here is revolutionary, but like Kleon's previous book *Show Your Work*, I have a feeling I will return to this again and again.
