This is an exercise that helps you [[Focus-on-what-is-in-your-control]]. Draw two overlapping circles, a Venn diagram. On the left, write 'What is in my control?' On the right, write 'What is outside of my control?' And in the middle write 'What can I influence'. Then fill it in with whatever it is you are worrying about.

Remember [[notes-are-inputs-for-action]] so use it to take concrete action.
