Lots of people can write well or make the art you do, but they come to your art for the specific combination of weird you bring to it. Whatever things interest you or you are nerdy about, embrace those and pursue them, no matter how weird or specific. For example, Harry Giles is deeply passionate about maths and has been phenomenally successful.
