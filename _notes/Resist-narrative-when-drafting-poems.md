When writing poems, the temptation could be to twist the poem into a flash story, to have narrative closure at the end. [[Everything-is-a-Story]] is a story and we are narrative beings after all.  
  
However, try to resist this impulse. Instead, focus on concrete images and metaphors, building up a tapestry instead of an explicit narrative. This is useful when drafting as it forces you to focus on the language instead of the story.  
  
I am guilty of twisting poems to story too soon.  
  
Like all writing advice, this depends on the poem you are writing.  
  
This comes from the [[Monday Night Write club]] with [[Chris-Redmond]].
