## Life

- Trying to be kind to myself and others. Focusing on self care. Taking my medicine, metaphorically by journaling and meditating more.
-  Planning a spontaneous holiday to Bergen.

## Working on

- Promoting *Emergence*. Why not [pick up a copy today?](https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/announcing-emergence/)
- Getting back to performing.
- Photo a day to get me back into photography.
- Switching my website to Eleventy from [[Jekyll]]. Posts are imported, project pages are built, now I'm styling the pages. Would like to add notes into the main site but that is proving tricky.
- Working through project management apprenticeship at work
