## Life

- Planning holidays
- Looking for a new car after my ancient Micra finally gave up the ghost.
- Reviving the garden after neglect over the winter. Laying down mulch, planting herbs and sowing peas and beetroot.

## Working on

- Photo a day to get me back into photography.
- Planning Dungeons and Dragons campaign. 
- Project Dust.  Done a full rebuild after Libre Office chewed up my last draft. End is in sight now.
