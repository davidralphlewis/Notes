## Working on

- Getting read to launch Project Dust. Pamphlets ordered, just waiting for delivery.
- Photo a day to get me back into photography.
- Switching my website to Eleventy from [[Jekyll]]. Posts are imported, project pages are built, now I'm styling the pages. Would like to add notes into the main site but that is proving tricky.
- Working through project management apprenticeship at work
