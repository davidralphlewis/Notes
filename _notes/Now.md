## Life

- Trying to be kind to myself and others. Focusing on self care. Taking my medicine, metaphorically by [[Journaling]] and [[Meditating]] more.
- Winding down the year and hibernating for winter.
- December is for reflection

## Working on

- Promoting *Emergence*. Why not [pick up a copy today?](https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/announcing-emergence/)
- Decluttering and sorting the house.
- Getting Christmas presents!
- Photo a day to get me back into photography.
- Switching my website to Eleventy from [[Jekyll]]. Posts are imported and project pages are built. Would like to add notes into the main site but that is proving tricky.
- Working through project management apprenticeship at work
