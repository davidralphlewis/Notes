## Life

- Trying to be kind to myself and others. Focusing on self care. Taking my medicine, metaphorically by [[journaling]] and [[meditating]] more.

## Working on

- Getting back to performing.
- Decluttering the house
- Photo a day to get me back into photography.
- Switching my website to Eleventy from [[Jekyll]]. Posts are imported and project pages are built. Would like to add notes into the main site but that is proving tricky.
- Working through project management apprenticeship at work
