Start your day with a small misery that won't kill you to be aware of the discomfort you will face in the day. It's why people have cold showers (I assume). I first heard this on [[The-Blindboy-Podcast]].

It's a reminder that [[Life-is-Suffering]].

Similiar to the stoic philosophy best expressed by Marcus Aurelius:

> Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness – all of them due to the offenders’ ignorance of what is good or evil.
