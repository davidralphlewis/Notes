#[[WritingWorkshop]] 

# Voice and performance.

## Page and stage is a false dichotomy

- Poetry like most thing is not binary, itâ€™s a spectrum between page and stage. ([[Binaries-are-bullshit]])
- The most extreme version of page is concrete poetry. 
- The most extreme version of voice is sound poetry.

## Stay close to natural speaking voice.

Departure comes at cost of understanding.

## Can flip between page and stage

See them as different tools you can use.

## Compose a poem using the voice.

## End sooner than you think

## Imitate other poet's performance

## Pick a recognizable voice, write something that subverts it.

## Apply for everything! Give it a go.
