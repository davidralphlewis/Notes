[[Poetic Forms]] can be intimidating. There's a lot of rules so it can be hard to know where to start. Here are some approaches.

-   Jacob Samuel Rose in  Apples and Snakes workshop I was in ([[Red Sky Session 2]]) said to try different parts of the form in stages. So for a [[Sonnet]] you might try writing a fourteen line poem, then you might add in a turn, then maybe try iambic pentameter, then add in rhyme. In this way you build up the elements of the form slowly and get used to what each part does.
-   Similarly, immerse yourself in one form for a bit. write lots of examples and see what they can do. See where the limitations are and where the flexibility is.
-   Just mess around and remember [[Art is Play]]. Remove the pressure to get it 'right'.
