*Getting Things Done* is a book by David Allen that has achieved a certain level of cult status among productivity gurus. It's easy to explain but hard to implement.

1.  Write everything you need to get done into an inbox
2.  Process your inbox regularly. If a task takes two minutes or less, do it. If not, move it to a context where it will be done later.
3.  Create projects if a task has two or more steps
4.  Keep a future list.
5.  Keep a someday/maybe list
6.  Run a [[Weekly-Review]] regularly.

(I haven't actually read it but have digested numerous summaries.) 

This is fine by itself. Writing every task down in a [[brain-dump]] helps clear your mind, and is a good example of the [[Extended-Mind]] theory. Checking on them regularly is also a good idea. I do both all the time.

What I dislike about the process is a certain amount of jargon and [[Tool-Fundamentalism]] People argue endlessly about the right way to implement the process, when they should just take what works for them. For me, the multiple lists and lack of prioritisation don't really work, so I ditched them.

Also, as [[Self-Help-Ignores-Systemic-Solutions]], this means [[Productivity-is-a-Plaster]].
