Attention is the most important resource we have.  It is what we use to define our world, how we [[Be-Present]].  It defines if you can be lied to or how you [[decide what is important to you]] It creates our personal reality and defines our world.

No wonder [[Social-Media-is-Designed-to-Capture-Our-Attention]].

- Jay Springett has a zine called *Your Attention is Sovereign.*
 
> Attention, on the other hand, just is life: your experience of being alive consists of nothing other than the sum of everything to which you pay attention.
> -- [[Four-Thousand-Weeks-by-Oliver-Burkeman-2021]]

>The water thrushes, down among the sloppy  
rocks, are going crazy with happiness. Imagination is better  
than a sharp instrument. To pay attention, this is our endless  
and proper work.
> *Yes! No!*- Mary Oliver
