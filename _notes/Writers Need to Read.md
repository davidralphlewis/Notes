In the same way that visual artists need to be immersed in images, writers need to read and [[Read Widely]].

Read in your subject matter to see what everyone else is doing and where the gaps are.

Read actively, [[Make Marginalia]] as you go. Reading is a conversation between the reader and the author.

[[Steal to Create]] what techniques you can.

> Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.
>â€” Joseph Addison
