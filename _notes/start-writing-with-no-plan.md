[[Start-before-you-are-ready]] writing, with no plan. This is especially useful for creative work and writing as once you've started writing you can edit what you have. This way you are [[Writing-From-the-Subconscious]]

Start a story with no idea where it's going. Start a poem using [[Prompts]]. [[Embrace-Randomness]]. It can help you overcome [[Writers-Block]]
