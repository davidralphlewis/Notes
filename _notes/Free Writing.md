One of the most useful tools when starting to write something and one of the simplest. You  [[write-to-a-timer]], usually for 10 to 15 minutes and try not to lift your pen off the page. You don't edit or censor yourself but write fast, following any tangent you want to.

You could also try [[bibliomancy]] as a way of generating new ideas.

It's useful because it starts you writing and overcoming ideas. It avoids [[Writers Block]] and allows you to [[just-start]]. It also allows you to start [[Writing from the subconscious]] because you go fast without censorship.

Similar to [[0th Draft]] or [[Morning-pages]], it's writing without judgement. You can always go back and [[Editing A Poem|edit]] it later.

-   Tim Clare has a lot of free write sessions to a timer as part of his free course on his podcast *Death of 1,000 cuts.*
-   In a workshop with Mailika Booker,</a> she suggested doing a focused free write. Start with a subject and write what you know and what is related to it.
