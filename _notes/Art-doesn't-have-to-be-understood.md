When we talk about art, we often talk about it in terms of meaning and comprehension. But we don't always have to understand art in a conscious way. Instead, we can react to how it makes us feel without fully understanding the meaning of every part of it.

This works for art we produce as well. When we are [[Writing-From-the-Subconscious]] we don't have to fully understand what we have produced.
