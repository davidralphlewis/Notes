#BookNotes 

Authors: [[Robert Macfarlane]] and [[Stanley Donwood]]

Strange prose poem and illustrations dealing with Orford Ness, the abandoned nuclear testing site. It shows the natural world getting revenge on those whole caused destruction, in an unnerving way. 

Link to [[Entangled Life-Merlin Sheldrake]] with the praise of fungi and how alien then are. Also how [[Nature is an Elder God]], vengeful and unknowable.
