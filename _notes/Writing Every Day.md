I have complicated feelings about the advice that is usually given to writers about writing every day. I wrote a <a href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/writing-every-day/" >blog post about</a> which I still stand by. In short- do what you can, but don't put too much pressure on yourself.

I think itâ€™s more important to establish a [[Creative Routine]] rather than beating yourself up if you miss a day.
