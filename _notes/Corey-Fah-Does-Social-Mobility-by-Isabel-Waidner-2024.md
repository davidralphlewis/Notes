Author: [[Isabel-Waider]]

A very strange book about a writer winning a literary prize and their attempts to actually claim it. From the very first chapter it goes weird, including a twisted version of Bambi, UFOs and time travel. Concerned with the weirdness of society, takes existing norms and pushes them until they are absurd.
