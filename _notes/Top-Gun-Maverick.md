1.  Tension and genuine danger. Unsure who will survive.
2.  Archetypes but written sincerely. Predictable character arcs will go but played well.
3.  Everyone has own motivations and are often conflicting.
4.  [[Specific-Detail]]Detail</a> enriches world and makes it feel realistic. Don't understand tech jargon, but adds to world.
5.  Using different film structure to genre- it works as a heist film, but with planes.
