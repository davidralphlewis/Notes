#BookNotes 

-   English identity is false ([[Every nation is fictional]]) - we are distrusting and suspicious 
-   Ancient gods still hold power (a bit like *American Gods*)
-   Outsiders vs insiders even in the same village.
-   Playing with language and layout, especially with the ancient god ([[Form Reflects Content]]).
