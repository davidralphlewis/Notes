When reading, make notes in the margins. It seemed sacrilegious to me at first but soon it helped me analyse poetry and highlight lines I liked.

It's turns reading from an passive process into [[Active Reading]].

I highlight what I like by underlining, then ask myself questions about the writing. What are they doing and how do they achieve their effect? It gives you techniques to feed into your own work when [[Editing A Poem]].
