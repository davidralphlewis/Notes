[[BookNotes]] author: [[Patricia-Lockwood]]

-   Surreal and funny stream of consciousness reflecting the disjointed and strange nature of social media in the middle of [[Context-Collapse]].

-   Like [[Solutions-or-Other-Problems-Allie-Brosh]] it starts hilarious then broadsides you halfway through with personal tragedy.

-   A reminder that life is ultimately not about being online. [[Disconnect-Frequently]] and [[Be-Present]], you cannot live on the internet.
