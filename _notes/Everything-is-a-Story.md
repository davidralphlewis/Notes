Humans are narrative beings. We perceive everything through the lens of story. [[History-is-Always-Edited]] and fits a narrative arc when we retell it. News supplies stories daily that we fit ourselves in. We like to think of our life in terms of story structures- redemption arcs, the lone hero against everything. 

Counterpoint though [[Life-isnt-a-story]]
