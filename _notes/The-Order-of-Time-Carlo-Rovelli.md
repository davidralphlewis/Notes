[[BookNotes]]

An exploration of time from a physics point of view. I read it as I'm getting older and wondered what the hell time is anyway. I'm not sure I found out.  

## Key ideas

### Time is relative

- It runs at different speeds at different places. Up a mountain, it is slower. In space, it is slower still. It is also affected by speed. The faster something moves the less time passes.

-   Mass slows time around it.

-   Sun and earth fall around each other due to time.

-   Gravity is time

-   Speed slows down time.
  

###  The only law of physics that is directional is heat.

-   Always goes hot to cold, never the other way round.

-   Seeking equilibrium. Entropy.

-   Heat is the only distinction between past and future.

  

###   Entropy is relative

-   No distinction between cause and effect.

-   No shared present, multiple overlapping present times.

-   can overlap and circle back

  

### Time is a field, acted on by other forces.

- Can stretch and change.

- Time is granular, made up of Planck seconds- smallest divisible unit.

- Time exists in a superposition. Unsure of how it exists until it interacts with the world.

- Therefore the past, present and the future are indeterminate
