#Poeticform 

A poem which only uses one vowel. So words need to only have one of *a, e, i, o, u* and sometimes *y.* A form of [[Constrained Writing]]

-   Cathy Park Hong's *<a href="https://poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/53500/ballad-in-a" >Ballad in A</a>* is an excellent example of the form:

> Marshall’s a marksman, maps Kansan’s track,  
> calm as a shaman, sharp as a hawk,  

-   Dan Simpson's *<a href="https://dansimpsonpoet.wordpress.com/2017/09/29/dads-black-cab/" >Dad's Black Cab</a>* is a univocalic in A.
