Probably the most famous TTRPG, where you and friends search for treasure and become heroes in a fantasy world.

I've been starting to run sessions as a Dungeon Master and have really enjoyed the collaborative storytelling aspect of it. There's a lot of rules and a lot of dice but where it shines is sitting around a table making things up again. It feels like an adult form of [[Art-is-Play]]
