If you share what you learn in public, you can get feedback and learn faster. It’s a reason why [[Only Public Writing Matters]].

I also find that writing for public consumption refines my thoughts. Publication means I need to be more precise in my writing, which I may be wouldn't be if I was just writing these notes for myself.

> I resist putting writing out in public when the ideas aren’t completely developed. This is pathological in two ways. First, no idea is ever completely developed. Second, putting half-baked ideas out into the world improves them by exposing them to questions and criticisms from people who did not come up with the idea and are not blind to its flaws.
