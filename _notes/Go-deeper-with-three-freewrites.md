[[Free-Writing]] is useful, but you can also stack them together to go deeper. This is similar to [[Structured-free-writing]].

- Start with a memory. For the first freewrite, focus on images. What can you see?  
- For the next one, focus on other senses. What can you hear? What can you feel or smell?  
- Finally, freewrite around your emotions. How did you feel? How do you feel now about the memory?  
  
From these paragraphs of text, underlines you like. Then try to draft a poem.
