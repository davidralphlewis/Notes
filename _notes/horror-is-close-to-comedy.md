Horror and comedy share the same DNA. Both rely on the unexpected, both build to a punchline or deal in absurd situations. The emphasis on both is different of course- horror uses the unexpected to shock you, whereas comedy the unexpected makes you laugh.

## Examples

- [[Severance-season-1]] is directed in part by a comedian (Ben Stiller) and stars a comic actor (Adam Scott). The situations throughout are unsettling and strange, feeling like hte beats of comedy but with a horror undertone. 
- [[Gremlins]] is horror, but with a wicked sense of humour.
