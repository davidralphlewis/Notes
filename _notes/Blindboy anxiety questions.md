Here are some questions to ask yourself to analyse your anxiety, taken from the Blindboy Podcast. Go listen to the <a href="https://play.acast.com/s/blindboy/13stepsiusetomanageanxiety" >full episode</a>, which explains these in more detail.

1.  Am I jumping to the worst possible conclusion?
2.  Am I thinking in extreme black and white terms?
3.  Am I using words like always/ never to draw conclusions from a specific event?
4.  Am I predicting the future instead of waiting to see what happens?
5.  Am I jumping to conclusions about what other people think of me?
6.  Am I focusing only on the negative information and ignoring the positive?
7.  Am I discounting positive information or twisting positive into a negative?
8.  Am I globally putting myself down as a failure or useless?
9.  Am I listening too much to my negative gut feelings instead of looking at objective facts?
10. Am I taking an event or someone's behaviour too personally?
11. Am I using words like should or must or ought to make rules about the world or how I'm treated?
12. Am I telling myself that something is too difficult when actually its bearable and worth it?
