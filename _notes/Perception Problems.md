We think we experience the real world but we do not at all. Our perception of the world is deeply flawed

Look at [[Colour Constancy]], where our brain decides what colour we should see. Or [[Apophenia]] where we see patterns that aren't there. Or [[Chronostasis]], where the first second of a clock is seemingly suspended in time. 

Our memories are flawed because [[Everything is a Story]]. Look at the [[The Mandela Effect]].

We have a strong [[Negativity Bias]]. We are more sensitive to losses than gains. We overestimate the risks of that which is vivid and immediate in the[[Availability Heuristic]]

We forget where we found information and experiernce [[Source Amnesia]]

Still though, because of the [[Dunning Kruger Effect]]we might not know what we don't know.

The flip side of this is due to [[The Flynn Effect]], people are getting smarter all the time.
