Over the top, grotesque depiction of upper class life. Rich are callous and uncaring and use people like toys. 

Main character is a psychopath which undermines the class struggle message. His tragic backstory is made up because of an obsession with his friend. Film tries to paint him as a supergenius but he is more opportunistic. 

Weird to now see a film based in 2006 looking back. It was when I went to uni.

Mostly enjoyable shlock, although it falls apart if you think about it more than a little bit.
