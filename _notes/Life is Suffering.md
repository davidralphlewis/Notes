A Buddhist philosophy. Life is defined by constant suffering. There is always something wrong with our lives and we are never content. Instead, we try to fight against the suffering and avoid it instead of accepting it. (Fighting against it is also a form of suffering.)

[[Meditating|Meditation]] in the Buddhist tradition is a way of accepting the inevitable suffering of life.
