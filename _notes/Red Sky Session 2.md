#WritingWorkshop 

[[Red Sky Sessions]]] No 2 with Jacob Samuel Rose.

## What is form?
- [[Poetic Forms]] are rulesets that have been designed and codified over the years
- Rhythmic patterning and metre- works differently in other languages 
- Stanza length and line length

## Form does not equal structure

-   Structure is the way a poem's thinking moves
-   Eg. A turn is a shift in trajectory.

## Form can open things up by constraint.
- A way to use [[Constrained Writing]] to free your imagination.

## Form can be a layer of meaning.
- [[Form Reflects Content]]

## Try attempting form in stages.

-   Eg  for a [[Sonnet]] start with 14 lines, then add in Iambic pentameter, then add in the rhyme scheme

## Inhabit a form for a while. Live in it and see what it does.

## Novel forms are unique takes on constrained thinking.
- Eg. [[Golden Shovel]].
- Offer them for others

## [[Read Widely]], pay attention to what others are doing.

## Leda & the Swan- Jaqueline Saphra

-   Traditional form of white man. Twists it and makes it her own
-   Rejection of traditional [[Sonnet]] form.
-   Refuses to look away. Violence is not glamorised.

## Rewrite same poem in different forms.
