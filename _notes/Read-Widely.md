Don’t just confine yourself to one genre. Read outside your chosen discipline. [[Be-Interdisciplinary]]. Read as much as you can from all different subjects. 

>It is the same with trash movies, trash TV. Wrestlemania. The Kardashians. I'm fascinated by it. So I don't say read Tolstoy and nothing else. Read everything. See everything. The poet must not avert his eyes.

> We also, I say, ought to copy these bees, and sift whatever we have gathered from a varied course of reading, for such things are better preserved if they are kept separate; then, by applying the supervising care with which our nature has endowed us, – in other words, our natural gifts, – we should so blend those several flavours into one delicious compound that, even though it betrays its origin, yet it nevertheless is clearly a different thing from that whence it came._ 
>—Seneca, Epistle LXXXIV
