When you are [[Editing A Poem]], read the poem or words out loud. Writing is a translation of an oral medium so you are trying to make the work sound natural. Reading a poem out loud will show where you stumble, where the writing is forced and unnatural. Of course, you might want to keep it like this, but if you read it out loud it highlights those parts to you, allowing you to make a decision about them. It also shows you the sound and rhythm of the words.
