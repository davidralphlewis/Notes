We know [[Walking-is-helpful-for-your-mental-health]]. It can also be deeply meditative, as you are moving at the speed of thought and it is a good way to [[Be-Present]]. It's a way to practise [[Meditating]] without being still.

Slow down, pay attention to the sounds of your feet, the colours of the leaves, feel the wind on your face.

> Yes, we are in motion when we walk, but it is not frenzied motion or even conscious motionâ€”it is repetitive, ritualized motion. It is deliberate. It is an exercise in peace.
