This idea is from [[Make Time-Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky]]. In order to avoid overwhelm, choose one main thing to focus on a day, then avoid distractions to do it. They suggest you only need 60 - 90 minutes to drill down on the piece of work.

The idea is by only doing this one thing, you [[Set Limits]] on what you can realistically do and you [[Acknowledge Your Limitations]].  But you also set time aside for [[Creative Flow]]. 

[[Small Changes Add Up]]. Instead of scattering your attention on one thing, you are focusing your attention on one single thing. 

> Your Highlight is not the only thing you’ll do each day. After all, most of us can’t ignore our inboxes or say no to our bosses. But choosing a Highlight gives you a chance to be proactive about how you spend your time instead of letting technology, office defaults, and other people set your agenda.

> You’re already close. Small shifts can put you in control. If you reduce a few distractions, increase your physical and mental energy just a bit, and focus your attention on one bright spot, a blah day can become extraordinary. It doesn’t require an empty calendar—just sixty to ninety minutes of attention on something special. The goal is to make time for what matters, find more balance, and enjoy today a little more.
