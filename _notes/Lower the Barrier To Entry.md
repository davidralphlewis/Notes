When you face resistance to starting anything, lower the barrier to entry until you itâ€™s easier to do it than not.

One way is to follow the [[Ten Minute Rule]] for a task, but others might be writing one sentence. Or if you want to clean up, start with washing up one plate.

It works psychologically because it becomes easier to [[Just Start]]. And once you've started, it's easier to continue.
