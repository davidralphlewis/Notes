What an incredible film. All based around one initial conversation and a man listening in. Francis Ford Copella was on a hot streak.

- Paranoid film noir about the fear of being seen and known. Feels prescient, predicting our current surveillance culture. Watching others makes you paranoid, because others could be watching you.
- Harry is alone in the world because he pushes people away and never lets them in. He is always at a distance so people keep him at a distance.
- Almost everything is inferred, nothing is explicit. A perfect example of [[Show-Dont-Tell]]
