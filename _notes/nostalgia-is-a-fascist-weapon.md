[[Nostalgia-is-always-false]] but is often used by fascists to prey on people's insecurities. By presenting an idealised past they can use violence to justify returning to it. Nostalgia also implies the present is corrupted or fallen, meaning they can justify ways of scapegoating peoples in order to return.

Don't believe their lies. [[Real solutions are new and different]].
