#BookNotes 

Such a beautiful, powerful book. I hesitate to call it a novel because there's almost no plot. Instead, there are six monologues that weave in and out of each other. The writing is incredible, so detail rich and hypnotic in their delivery. Towards the end it becomes deeply melancholic and overwhelming. This utterly blew me away.

* Interlinking monologues almost like a [[Prose Poem]]

> In a world which contains the present moment,' said Neville, 'why discriminate? Nothing should be named lest by so doing we change it. Let it exist, this bank, this beauty, and I, for one instant, steeped in pleasure.
