[[Writing-Workshop]]

This was a workshop with [[Edson-Burton]]  about poetry and class. I sat in on it while volunteering at Lyra festival. 

## Key Ideas

-  [[Poetry-reflects-the-dominant-society-and-class]]
- What is the language of poetry? Does using different vernacular change how poetry is percieved? 
- As an example- Jean Binta Breeze translated Chaucer's *Wife of Bath* into  Brixton vernacular.
