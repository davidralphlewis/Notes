Pomodoro is a technique to practise [[Focus]]. Set a timer for 25 minutes and work solidly on one thing. Then have a break for 5 minutes and start again.

I find this is really helpful when I'm struggling to focus. It's not enough time to get distracted and it's long enough to get things done. It helps you [[Start-before-you-are-ready]].
