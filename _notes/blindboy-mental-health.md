Lessons from a [[Blindboy-Boatclub]] podcast episode on mental health. Don't know which one  didn't write it down (cursed [[Source-Amnesia]])

- Accept the world as it is.
- Suffering is inevitable - [[Life-is-Suffering]]
- [[suffering-is-the-trade-off-for-experiencing-joy]], for being human
- Have an aim simply to cope
- Check in with how you feel constantly ([[Know-Yourself]])
-  [[practise-radical-empathy]]
- Find meaning, [[notice-if-you-are-not-finding-any-meaning]]
- If you are not, [[Be-Present]] instead
