Taken from <a href="https://tanaudel.wordpress.com/2020/05/25/five-things-to-steal-through-the-woods/" >Katherine Jennings</a> (who adapted it from [[Austin Kleon]]), this is a method of making notes on things you experience. You find  things you admire, then try to imagine how you can adapt or transform them. 

It's partly a way to [[Copy to Understand the Rules]] and partly a way to [[Transform Existing Work]] to your own ends. 

Five is a good number as it streches you to think beyond the obvious.
