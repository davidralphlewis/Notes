Atomic notes are superior to long rambling ones. You need to quickly encapsulate a concept and easily refer back to it. Short notes act as nodes in a hyperlinked web of thought ([[Network Better Than Linear]]).

A note captures the essential parts of an idea. If an idea develops, it should be added to a new note. This is one of the guiding principles of the [[Zettlekasten]] system.

It's important to avoid [[Collectors Fallacy]].

This is a [[Meta Notes]].
