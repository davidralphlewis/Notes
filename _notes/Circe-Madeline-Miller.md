 This book retells the myth of Odysseus from the perspective of Crice, trapped on her island. Similar to *The Penelopiad* by Margaret Atwood or *The Silence of the Girls* by Pat Barker.

-   Power of empathy instead of seeking fame or political power.
-   The patriarchal and cruel society of Olympian gods is reflected in Odysseus and the mortals.
-   Questions whether heroes of myth were actually heroic. It's an example of how [[History-is-Written-by-the-Winners]].
