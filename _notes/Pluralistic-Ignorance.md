This is a [[Cognitive-Bias]] where you resist speaking up about an issue because you think others agree with it. Actually, others may object as well. For example, you might drink to excess because you think that everyone else wants to do it, whereas the majority don't actually want to.

It can be challenged by talking about it and making the norms visible.
