[[BookNotes]]

author: [[Ryan-Holiday]]

Non-fiction book by Ryan Holiday that takes the idea of stillness from many different religions and applies it to the modern day, using historical figures to expand on the ideas.

Holiday praises the idea of stillness of mind, drawing a lot from stoic philosophy. It's similar in this respect to [[Four-Thousand-Weeks-by-Oliver-Burkeman-2021]].

## Key Ideas

- [[Slow-Down]] and [[embrace-silence]]
- [[Be-Present]] - ([[Being-Present-Reveals-More-Detail]])
- [[define-what-is-enough-for-you]]
- [[happiness-does-not-lie-in-external-validation]]
- [[peace-comes-from-within]]

On journaling:

- [[journaling-allows-you-to-be-present]]
- [[journaling-helps-you-examine-your-emotions]]
- [[Writing-is-a-way-of-externalising-our-thoughts]]

Good habits:

- [[go-outside]]
- [[practice-mitfreude]]
- [[Practise-Doing-Nothing]]
- [[you-should-have-a-hobby]]
- [[Walking-is-helpful-for-your-mental-health]]
- [[walking-can-be-meditation]]
- [[Reduce-distractions]]
- [[step-away-from-noise-to-recharge]]
- [[use-time-as-a-tool]]
- [[do-less-to-do-more]]
- [[reflect-on-your-life-regularly]]
- [[reflect-when-calm]]

## Criticism

It's worth remembering [[Self-Help-Ignores-Systemic-Solutions]]. Holiday ignores a lot of the systems the historical figures find themselves in.

[[self-help-ignores-privilege]]. Most of the people Holiday talks about are white, male and wealthy which gives them more control over their attempts to find stillness. 

Mostly Holiday does a good job of exploring the complexities and contradictions of people but with Winston Churchill he ignores his many crimes, which feels like an omission.
