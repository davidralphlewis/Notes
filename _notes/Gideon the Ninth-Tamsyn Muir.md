fantasy and science fiction, with rituals, monks and necromancy but also spaceships and technology. The language works in a similar way, combining formal, ritualised and archaic language with more up to date slang and quips. There's also a lot of classical references within the characters that contrast with their natures, most especially with the two teenagers. It's a rich, detailed unique world, but the downside of this is there's too much mythology to get through. A lot of the characters and lore get lost within the worldbuilding.
