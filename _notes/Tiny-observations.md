Inspired by [[Tiny-Prep]]

Roll a d6 then do one the following. Can be as short or as long as you like


1. What you can see
2. What you can hear
3. What you can feel
4. What you can taste
5. What you can smell
6. What you are thinking

Similar to [[The-Five-Senses]] exercise, this helps you [[Observe-the-world]].
