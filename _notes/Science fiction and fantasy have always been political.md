Science fiction, fantasy and speculative fiction have always been inherently political, because they are imagining worlds that are different from or that reflect the existing status quo.

Who gets to imagine is also political. In the fifties and sixties most mainstream sci and fantasy was white and male, reflecting their dominance at that time. However, recently more diverse voices have been published, leading to accusations that scif gas become political. But its always been political.
