 You should [[Slow-Down]] and do less generally.  Stop trying to do everything and instead focus on a few small things. [[set-limits-on-what-you-do]]

Paradoxically, this will help you do more. The things you choose to do will be more meaningful and you will enjoy them more. This leads to more action, instead of overwhelm.
