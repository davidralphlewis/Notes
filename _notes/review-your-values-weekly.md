As [[It-is-important-to-write-down-your-values]], when you do a [[Weekly-Review]], make sure you check in with them. You can then ask:

- What did I do to live my values in the last week?
- What actions can I take to live my values more?
- Are my values still relevant?

Remember [[notes-are-inputs-for-action]].

This idea comes from [[Anna-Havron]]
