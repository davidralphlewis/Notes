Every notetaking method needs some notes explaining the system used (e.g. [[Obsidian]]) and how it works (e.g. [[Network-Better-Than-Linear]]). This [[Digital-Garden]] is no different. These are meta notes, notes about notes.

Technically, this note is a meta meta note, a note about notes about notes.
