Invented by Nicholas Lumen, this is a knowledge management system that has gained popularity in recent years due to *How to Take Smart Notes* (which I haven't read.)

It's a series of small notes ([[Notes Should Be Atomic]]) linked together. Lumen used index cards and created a [[Network Better Than Linear|network]] of interconnected notes, using an alphanumeric system to get paths and see clusters of thought.

Strictly, this is not a Zettlekasten, it is a wiki. But the principles have helped me to design it. And you need to avoid [[Tool Fundamentalism]] anyway.

It's also important to avoid the [[Collectors Fallacy]].
