One of the main reasons I use [[Emacs]].

It is an outlining system that allows you to fold parts of your document, hiding them from view. You can also assign statuses and dates to different headlines, meaning it works as a task manager as well. I use it for writing and also to organise my life. I can quickly capture notes and tasks.

Everything is in [[Plain-Text]]. I can quickly search through multiple documents to find what I want. I have custom statuses set up for different files, so I can see which poems I have sent to publishers and which ones need revising for example. I can quickly move the headlines and content around and export it to custom formats.. Plus, almost everything is assigned to a keyboard shortcut by default so it is fast to navigate.
