[[Meta-Notes]]

An idea from a [[Odysseas]] [video](https://youtu.be/s3k_MeqZyk0?si=0CHMK1kxvJnOPAZp) to avoid wasting time. 

If something is entertainment  watch and enjoy it. If it is practical or useful, then make notes on it. Engage in [[Active-Reading]]. Remember [[everything-is-a-possible-source]]
