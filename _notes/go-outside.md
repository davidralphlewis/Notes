One thing that has greatly helped my mental health is to go outside, sometimes for a walk ([[Walking-is-helpful-for-your-mental-health]]). It's essential to escape the house and dive into nature.

This was especially apparent during lockdown, when outside time was limited. Suddenly I realised just how necessary it was. 

Your thoughts tend to expand outwards, even if it's raining.



>Professor John Stilgoe has simple advice: Get out now. Not just outside, but beyond the trap of the programmed electronic age so gently closing around so many people. . . . Go outside, move deliberately, then relax, [[Slow-Down]], look around. Do not jog. Do not run. . . . Instead pay attention to everything that abuts the rural road, the city street, the suburban boulevard. Walk. Stroll. Saunter. Ride a bike and coast along a lot. Explore.
