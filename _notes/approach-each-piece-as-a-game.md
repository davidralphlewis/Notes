Idea from [[we-the-poets-podcast]] with [[Ross-Sutherland]]. [[Restrictions-Make-You-More-Creative]], so  try to approach each new piece as a game. Define the rules you are going to work from then the work comes from that. 

It means [[Art-is-Play]] and is also a way to [[Enjoy-the-creative-process]]
