[[Studio-Ghibli]] [[film-notes]] about a boy grieving his mother who is taken to a strange dimension. It starts as a simple tale of grief and trauma but evolve into questioning why we create things and what the point of life is. Looking at your life in revere, how you make things and how no-one will carry it on. 

The whole film has a strange dreamlike logic, with the rules of the fantasy world never being explicit. It's visually rich, with specific strange image that linger with you, like a sleeping woman turning to water, a heron having the face of a mad or a man and woman covered in paper strips.
