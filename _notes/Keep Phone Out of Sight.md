Phones are distraction machines. [[Attention is Everything]], so it is important to try and carve out time away from screens/ [[Disconnect Frequently]] and engage you [[Diffused Mode]] or [[Focused Mode]] away from the infinite scroll.

In order to focus on your highlight, Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky suggest putting your phone in a bag. A simple change, but if it's out of sight it's a lot less likely to distract you.

> Instead of keeping your phone by your side when you get home, put it in a drawer or on a shelf; better still, stow it in your bag and shut your bag in the closet.
