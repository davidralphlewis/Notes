#CognitiveBias 

This is thinking that a big event must have a big cause. For example, 9/11 was a huge tragedy that defined a generation, so it must have a big cause. Therefore it must be a conspiracy.

It's similar to the [[Availability Heuristic]] but it focuses on the origin of big emotional events instead of the related risk.

Another one of our many [[Perception Problems]].
