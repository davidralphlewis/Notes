Here in no particular order are the tools I use. (Remember the [[Tools Dont Matter]]). 

## Websites

-   My blog is built with [[Jekyll]]> and written in [[Emacs]] using markdown. The template is <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/" >Minimal Mistakes</a>.
-   This subdomain is written in [[Obsidian]], then built with Jekyll using <a href=“https://digital-garden-jekyll-template.netlify.app/”>this digital garden template</a>.
-   Both sites are hosted as separate repositories on GitHub pages and built using Netlify.

## Writing

-   I use a small cheap [[Writers Notebook]] for daily notes and snippets and a larger one for long form writing.
-   Daily, I do some [[Journaling]] in yet another notebook.
-   Months later, poetry is typed up into a single [[Org-Mode]] file in [[Emacs]] This gives me a chance to edit it with fresh eyes.
-   I send poems off to journals and edit again.
-   I also perform poems at [[Open Mics]] and [[slams]] or read them out loud and edit afterwards.
-   Snippets and ideas go into [[The Spark File]] to compost.
