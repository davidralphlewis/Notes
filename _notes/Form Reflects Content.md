The form of a piece will reflect the content and is another layer of meaning on top of the text. For example, a [[Sonnet]] is typically a devotional love poem, so by choosing this form a poet is commenting on love. 

One great example is [[Terminator 2 Judgement Day]], where the film is relentless and unstoppable, reflecting the persistence and chase of the T-1000.
