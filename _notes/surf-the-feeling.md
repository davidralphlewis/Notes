[[Nothing-lasts-forever]], not even the worst feelings. If you pay attention to a feeling and not let it consume you, it will last for half an hour maybe. You need to learn to use urge surfing to pay attention to the emotion.

Stop. [[Be-Present]] Observe your feeling. What does it look like? What shape is it? What colour? Ride the wave. Where in your body is it located? What physical symptoms do you have? For example, do you have a clenched jaw? Explore how it feels. Feel the emotion, then let it go.
