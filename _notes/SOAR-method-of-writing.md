When writing a formal evaluation of a piece of work or in a job interview, a way to make the situation clear is to use SOAR as a framework. It stands for:

Situation
Obstacle
Actions
Result

This lays out a clear narrative of what happened and how you overcame issues, with the specific actions you took.
