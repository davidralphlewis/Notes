A common place book is a collection of quotes and thoughts, all stacked on top of each other. It's a precursor to the [[Digital Garden]], less organised and more haphazard than the links would suggest.

I use one to copy poems and quotes, as opposed to [[Obsidian]], which tends to be a bit more developed.

I wrote a blog post on how I use it [here.](https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/inside-my-commonplace-book/)
