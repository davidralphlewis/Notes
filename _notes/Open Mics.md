Open mics do what they say. There is a microphone (usually) and it is open to any one. Usually you have a set amount of time to perform something. Thereâ€™s different types, music, comedy and poetry, or all three. 

Most poetry nights are five minutes or so, but this can vary. They may have headliners which do a longer set, usually about 20 minutes.

They are great places to try performing your work. Poetry audiences are typically very welcoming and supportive so it's a lovely place to experiment with reading things out.
