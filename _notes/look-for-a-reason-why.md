One of the reasons why you should [[Ask-Yourself-Why-More]] is to [[Know-Yourself]]. You should seek a reason why you are doing a particular thing or why you are using a particular tool in order to decide if it is worth doing. After you know why you are doing something, it is easier to [[be-intentional-with-your-time]].

Ask yourself [[does-this-serve-me]] to figure out why, or [[Ask-why-five-times]] to get to the heart of a matter.
