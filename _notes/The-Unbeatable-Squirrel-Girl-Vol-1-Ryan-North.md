#[[BookNotes]] 

Fun, whimsical comic with a stack of jokes on every page. I've long been a fan of Ryan North's Dinosaur Comics, and this brings the same level of jokes and smart thinking to the Marvel universe. It's a palette cleanser of a book. 

## [[5-things-to-steal]] 

- Relentless optimism
- Jokes on jokes (with hidden jokes)
- Creative resolutions to problems that don't involve hitting things after writing into a corner
- Meta Awareness of narrator, but not characters.
- Not taking itself too seriously.
