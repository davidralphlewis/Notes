Focus is important for well-being and work. It helps you learn the detail of new information because you are engaging the [[Focused-Mode]] of your brain.

We need to pay attention to one task and try not to pay attention to anything else.

Some ways to stay focused:

-   The [[Pomodoro]] method (and [[Write-to-a-Timer]] in general)
-   Exercise
-   [[Single-Task-Not-Multitask]]
-   No podcasts only music
- [[Break-big-tasks-into-tiny-steps]]
- [[Reduce-distractions]]
- [[turn-your-internet-off]]
- [[Three-projects-only]]
- [[theme-days-for-productivity]]
- [[Avoid-Overstimulation]]


However, it is important to also have breaks and engage the [[Diffused-Mode]]  of your brain in order to process what you are focusing on. Too much focus can remove creativity in the [[Einstellung-Effect]]
