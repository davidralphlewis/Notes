We constantly want more and more. We get used to a certain level of comfort then get restless, want more objects to soothe us. 

Instead, define what enough means for you and stick to that. It may be less than what society expects.

[[writing-down-your-values-leads-to-living-them]] so try and write down what enough means and reflect on it. 

You may also want to define enough by trying to [[set-limits-on-what-you-do]].
