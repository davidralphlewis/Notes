Conspiracy theories are modern folklore. They are stories that show the anxieties and worries and values of the people in the same way folklore does. They are stories about the world ([[Everything-is-a-Story]]) that help explain the chaos and distill it down into something more managable.

This idea orginated with [[Blindboy-Boatclub]] on his podcast.
