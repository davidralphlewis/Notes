[[BookNotes]] author: [[Daniel-Clowes]]

Short comic that plays off the format and style of Sunday morning comics. Instead of the cheap punchlines, we get a dense anxiety monologue from a reasonably unlikeable character who doesn't seem to engage with the world around him. As you might expect from a master of comics, Clowes delights in playing with the language of comic books, often placing thought boxes over dialogue boxes and inserting panels in different styles. There's a weird attitude to some of the wider social issues running throughout it, but mostly this is an entertaining read.
