Nothing stays still in life. Everything changes

> To be alive is to be in motion but never arriving anywhere
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QImCld9YubE]>(Why Are You Alive – Life, Energy)- Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell

> So it goes.
> - Slaughterhouse Five- Kurt Vonnegut Jr. 

> This too shall pass
> - Anon.

> No man steps in the same river twice, because it is not the same river and he is not the same man. 
> – Heraclitus

>There is nothing staid, nothing settled, in this universe. All is rippling, all is dancing; all is quickness and triumph.
> [[The Waves-Virginia Woolf]]
