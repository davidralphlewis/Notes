Because [[Language is always a translation of thoughts]], the act of writing is a form of thinking. In my creative practice, I do a lot of [[Writing from the subconscious]] so Iâ€™m never quite sure what I actually think about a subject until I start writing it down. Writing becomes an act of [[Embodied Cognition]], an extension of our selves and our mind  into the world.
