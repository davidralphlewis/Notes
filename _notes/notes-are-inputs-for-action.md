[[Meta-Notes]]

Raw notes by themselves are not useful. [[notes-should-have-an-end-product]] They may serve a purpose to get thought out of your head but beyond that they may not be helpful, unless you see them as inputs for future actions. 

[[you-need-a-system-to-process-raw-notes]] to turn them into actions

This idea is from [[Anna Havron]] but it is also mentioned by [[Ryder-Caroll]].
