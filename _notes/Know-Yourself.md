A commandment from Socrates that is easy to understand but difficult in practise. 

You should remain true to yourself, know your own motivations, [[Ask-Yourself-Why-More]]. In this way, you can [[Embrace-Your-Weird]]. 

[[follow-your-interests]] without fear and [[Choose-What-is-Important]]

Part of knowing yourself is to [[Acknowledge-Your-Limitations]]
