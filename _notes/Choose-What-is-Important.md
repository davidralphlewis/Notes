Because [[Our-Lives-Are-Brief]] and [[You-Will-Die]], it's important to [[Acknowledge-Your-Limitations]]. Once we have done this, we need to [[Be-Present]] and focus on what is important to you in order to create the life you want. But you cannot choose too many, because [[Any-Decision-Eliminates-Others]].

The actual choosing is hard, but essential.

> You have to choose a few things, sacrifice everything else, and deal with the inevitable sense of loss that results.
