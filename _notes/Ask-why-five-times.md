To get a deeper understanding of an issue and to [[Know-Yourself]], ask yourself why up to five times. Each time you get closer towards a new truth that you may not have anticipated. It is a more formal way to [[Ask-Yourself-Why-More]]

I first heard this idea in [[The-bullet-journal-method]] as a [[Journaling]] tool.
