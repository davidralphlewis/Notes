 [[Poetic-form]]

A poetic form invented by [[Terrance-Hayes]], where the end of each line is a quote or line.

In Hayes' *[The Golden Shovel](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/55678/the-Golden-shovel)*, the end of each line quotes Gwendolyn Brooks' *We Real Cool* in full.  

It's a fun form to play around in and a challenge as you have to bend your own lines into the existing words. It's a way to [[Transform-Existing-Work]] and create something new that comments on the original.
