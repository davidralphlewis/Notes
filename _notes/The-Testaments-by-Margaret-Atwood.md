[[BookNotes]]

Sequel to *The Handmaid's Tale*, dealing with the collapse of the totalitarian theocracy of Gilead.

## Key Themes

-   How totalitarian regimes collapse

-   The power of [[Everything-is-a-Story]] to control people's lives by omitting information and how the same erasure can be used against regimes.

-  How [[History-is-Written-by-the-Winners]] and is a story. How because [[History-is-Always-Edited]], it twists our perspective of our present and can be used to hide atrocities.

## Quotes  

> Once a story you've recorded as true has turned false, you begin suspecting all other stories
