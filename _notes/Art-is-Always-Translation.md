How many times have you had an idea for an incredible poem or art work, then gone to create it and it doesn't match up? This is because art is always a translation between our thoughts and the real world. In changing our firing synapses into language or images, there is always bound to be some loss. Art therefore is always a translation. [[Art-is-communication]], but inevitably some meaning will be lost. 

[[Perfection-Doesn't-Exist-when-making-art]], as much as we want to translate the thoughts into reality.
