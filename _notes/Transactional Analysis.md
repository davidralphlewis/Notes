A psychological concept saying that we move between three ego states- Child, parent and adult. The child is how you acted when you were a child, the parent is how authority has acted around you. The adult is balanced, staying in the here and now.

We shift between these, unconsciously pick up cues from others. For example, someone might speak with a raised voice, causing you to retreat to how you were as a child.

The goal is to stay in the adult, in the [[Be Present]] here and now.
