#BookNotes 

This is an antidote to productivity books that promise ways to do more with less time. There are no life hacks in this book. Instead, Burkeman writes a philosophical treatise on what it means to live. [[You Will Die]] and [[Our Lives Are Brief]] and limited, so [[Any Decision Eliminates Others]]. The antidote to this is to [[Slow Down]], [[Practise Doing Nothing]] and [[Embrace the Wonder of Being Alive.]] It's a beautiful, funny but also wise book that made me reassess my relationship to productivity and stop trying to do everything. Reading it on a beach in Croatia helped of course.
