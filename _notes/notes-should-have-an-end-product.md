Why take notes? Gaining knowledge by itself is useful, but in order to focus your learning you need to have a reason why you are creating your notes ([[Ask-Yourself-Why-More]]). One way to do this is to have an end product in mind, a reason for creating notes, an output that you are going to create. 

In my case it is poetry and blogposts, but yours may differ.
