If you are a creative and you aren't on social media, you may not sell much as no-one is aware of your work.However if you're well known, you don't have to be on social media.

I am prepared to make that bargain. [[Social-Media-is-Designed-to-Capture-Our-Attention]] and I would rather use that attention for something more valuable.
