A way of categorising your thoughts in a notebook using symbols as you write, invented by [[Ryder Caroll]]. The system is often used as a productivity tool or as an artistic outlet, but its also used as a way of [[Journaling]] and a way to [[Be Present]].

I've dipped into 
the system here and there, but fully committed in 2024, combining all my disparate notebooks together.

Its made up of a daily log, where you write tasks notes and events as they occur to you. There's an emphasis on a [[Weekly Review]] and [[Monthly Review]].

Remember [[It is Impossible to Capture Everything]]
