My <a href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk" >main blog</a> (and now this very site) is built with Jekyll, a free open-source [[Blogging]] platform. I was using Wordpress for years but found the site was too slow, especially for a mostly text based blog. Jekyll is a static site generator, so each page is html. As such, it's very fast to load. It's also hosted on Git Hub pages, meaning I don't need to pay for hosting any more. All I pay for is the domain, which is less than a tenner a year.

It's both easy and frustrating to use. The setup requires some html and css coding knowledge and some willingness for things to break. I found a template by <a href="https://github.com/dpstrange/jekyll-bootstrap" >DPStrange</a> then messed around with it until I had something I liked. But once it is set up, all the posts are written with markdown, so it is quick to write a fully formatted blog post.

You can view the code in my <a href="https://github.com/davidralphlewis/davidralphlewis.github.io/tree/master/" >github repo</a>. 

One of the reasons I switched these notes to [[Obsidian]] is to use Jekyll as a site generator
