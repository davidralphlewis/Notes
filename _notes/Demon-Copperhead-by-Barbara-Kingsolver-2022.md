Author: [[Barbara Kingsolver]]

I absolutely loved it. Kingsolver is hugely empathetic to all the characters, while never denying the hardships of being stuck in institutional poverty. It’s been a while since I read David Copperfield so I probably missed some of the parrallels, but she embraces Dickens’ fury at people being treated badly, against the state of things and the lack of help. Demon’s voice throughout feel completely authentic and I want to swim in some of the prose. It also ends in the perfect way.
