This law dictates 90% of everything is crap. 

It feels pessimistic but it helps with making things. If you have a consistent [[Creative-Routine]] you can remember that most of what you make will be rubbish. Instead of letting it crush you, it can be freeing as it allows you to [[Focus-on-Process-not-the-end-goal]].
