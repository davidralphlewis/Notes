I've kept a journal/ diary throughout my life, but more consistently since I was 25. I find it invaluable as a tool to reflect on each day as it passes and figure out how I'm feeling.

Recently, I've been using [[Lynda Barry]]'s [[observation journal]] method, suggested by Kathleen Jennings.

I've also added in questions I found from [[Struthless]]:

> 1. What excited me?
> 2. What drained me of energy?
> 3. What did I learn?
> – Campbell Walker, aka [[Struthless]]

(It's worth checking out his videos, especially <a href="https://youtu.be/dArgOrm98Bk" >this one</a> which highlights some of the reasons and ways to approach journaling)

I might ask myself some [[Questions for Self Reflection]] in order to prompt a response. If I'm feeling lazy I might do [[54321 journalling]] instead. Recently, I've started keeping a [[Bullet journal]].

I've also found keeping a [[haiku]] journal useful to develop my poetic craft and also observe small moments. 

> I love the diary because it knows itself to be a minor form; it isn’t trying to be anything but. It isn’t constructed, like a memoir; it is life as it happens.

> My planners, I know, will lie on the shelf where I have placed them, containing exactly what they contain, the concrete evidence of my hours, the things I did and the things I didn't do, tallied.

> I might not know what I meant 25 years or even 25 hours ago, but I do recognise the same essential impulse: to grab at life, tug at the details and hold onto them in the knowledge that although each moment, each thought may be fleeting and tenuous, together they make up the substance of our lives, day by day, year by year until we reach the final page.
