 When reading or analysing other people's work, look for what it doesn't cover. Then you can make something exploring those gaps. A reminder that [[Reading-is-Writing]]

This idea is from Lincoln Michel. 
 
> [[Read-Widely]], but also closely. Notice the openings, the gaps, and the fissures, as well as the unplowed fields, the unplucked branches, and the untrodden paths. Those are the places where your own work can bloom. [[https://omnivore.app/me/https-countercraft-substack-com-p-seeing-with-an-artists-eye-1907a522350#abc7b0f4-75f7-484f-a79c-bef41e62efeb]]
