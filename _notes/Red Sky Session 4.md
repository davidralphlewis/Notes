## Refining, editing & Selecting- Rachel Long

## Refining

- Remove impurities
- Poems are machines. 
- Put good stuff in: [[Read Widely]] and talk with new people 

## Gut is the best editor

- Need to train and trust. Other people are valuable, but hone your own voice 
- Constant process Try and experiment, learn and grow. 
- Read scientifically, analytical. How are they doing it?

## Lydia Davies treatment

Lydia Davies - Never includes, I think I feel I love I hate Communicates through action only

## Try different washes or styles of writers

## Editing as a creative process. An experiment ([[Editing is writing]])

## [[Poetic Forms]] as an editing tool

- What is there already? 
- Play within structure.

## Combine poems into a collection/ pamphlet.

Order in different ways.

## No gospel. Question everything.

## Look for [[specific-detail]].

## Get rid of redundancies

## Identify clich√©s

## We all have factory presets in poems
- How can you break out? 
- Should you?
## Making space.

[[show-dont-tell]]. Where do you want to be explicit?
