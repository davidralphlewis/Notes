Similar to the [[Weekly-Review]], this is a review of what I have been doing, interrogating it and then setting goals and projects for the next month.

Unlike a [[Weekly-Review]] which tends to focus on the immediate tasks that need to be done, I tend to look more at the big picture each month. I look at what projects I’m doing, what I would like to get done by the end of the month, what I’m giving my attention to.  It takes a bit longer because of this but it pays back in more focused attention for the month.
