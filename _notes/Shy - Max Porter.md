Author: [[Max Porter]]

Short poetic novella, with a stream of consciousness inside a troubled teenagers head. Very different to [[Lanny - Max Porter]] but has the same experimentation and playfulness with language and for. 

Shy is violent and unpredictable. The book implies a lot of things without making them explicit, like suicide and abuse. By the end, violence become cathartic and a release. It's not against a person, it's against the system and that's when he is finally accepted and loved.
