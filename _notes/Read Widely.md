Don’t just confine yourself to one genre. Read outside your chosen discipline. [[Be Interdisciplinary]]. Read as much as you can from all different subjects. 

>It is the same with trash movies, trash TV. Wrestlemania. The Kardashians. I'm fascinated by it. So I don't say read Tolstoy and nothing else. Read everything. See everything. The poet must not avert his eyes.
