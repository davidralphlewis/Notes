author: [[Jacqueline-Harpman]]

A terrifying vision of women in a cage in a basement. Harpman's novel never provides easy answers, but is vivid and full of intense detail. The narrator is cold and almost completely detached from the situation, which makes it even stranger. There's no real resolution, no answers to the situation but it remains with you and is haunting.
