This is a kingdom that does not exist, not really. It's a a small uninhabited island off Antigua and Barbuda, but the kingdom does not exist.

However, Kings of Redonda are appointed and can pass on the royal title to other people of literary merit. Occasionally the title is sold off. There is also a literary prize where people are awarded dukedoms and duchies.
