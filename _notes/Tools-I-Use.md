Here in no particular order are the tools I use. (Remember the [[Tools-Dont-Matter]]). 

## Websites

-   My main site is built with Eleventy and written in [[Obsidian]] using markdown. The site is hand coded, with [Sakura CSS](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura) used as a starting point.
-   The notes subdomain is written in [[Obsidian]], then built with Jekyll using <a href=“https://digital-garden-jekyll-template.netlify.app/”>this digital garden template</a>.
-   Both sites are hosted as separate repositories on GitHub pages and built using Netlify.

## Writing

-   I use a single [[Bullet-journal]] to capture everything- thoughts, dreams, tasks and poems. 
-   Months later, poetry is typed up into [[Obsidian]]. This gives me a chance to edit it with fresh eyes.
-   I also perform poems at [[Open-Mics]] and [[slams]] or read them out loud and edit afterwards.
-   Snippets and ideas go into [[The-Spark-File]] to compost.
