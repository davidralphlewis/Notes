r in mind that the sea of knowledge is deep and near infinite. 

There's always more to discover and find out and you should never think you have all the answers. I used to think this was depressing as you would never get full answers to things but in a way it's inspiring as there's always more to challenge your worldview. 

> I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.
> - Isaac Newton
