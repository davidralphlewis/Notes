#BookNotes 

-   Sci-fi as exploratory space for ideas, similar to other books in the Hanish series such as *The Unforgiven.*
-   More allegorical than other books in the series, drawing direct parallels to the Vietnam war.
-   Contrasts colonial attitudes with indigenous people.
-   Not straightforward i.e. the people burn and kill without mercy. Learn violence from colonial oppressors, no going back.
