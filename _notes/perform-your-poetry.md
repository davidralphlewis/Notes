One of the best ways to get your work out there and get feedback is through performing it. I fell into reading my poetry at [[Open-Mics]] a few years ago and fell in love with it.

There's a few different options. [[Open-Mics]]and [[slams]] are live options, but there's also performing your poetry to youtube or making poetry videos.

It's worth mentioning that performing your work is a separate skill to writing and one that needs just as much work.
