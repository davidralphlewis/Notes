[[BookNotes]]

A series of poems that merge Super Mario World with the story of the author's mother being treated for, and ultimately passing from cancer. It's a beautiful collection where each poem takes the title from a Super Mario stage. Contrasting the virtual world with the physical one is beautiful, and Sexton's control and play with language is beautiful. It's really interesting to see a whole collection of poems taking inspiration from video games and is something I hope we see more of.
