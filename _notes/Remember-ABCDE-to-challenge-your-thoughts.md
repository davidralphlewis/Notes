When challenging negative thoughts about yourself or your actions, use ABC as a framework for initial analysis.

A- Activating events. What caused you to feel this way?
B- Beliefs. What beliefs did you have about yourself that were a consequence of this event? Be as honest as possible. 
C- Consequences. What did you think as a result of these beliefs? Use I feel statements. What actions did you take.
D- Denial. How can you counteract these thoughts?
E- Evidence. What evidence is there to justify these beliefs.

Then [[Have-a-bias-towards-action]]. Remember [[actions-create-meaning]], so take some action to counteract this.

Another question that may be useful is [[What-would-you-say-to-a-friend]]
