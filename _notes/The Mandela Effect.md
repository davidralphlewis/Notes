A collective false memory that persists despite all available evidence. For example, lots of people believe Nelson Mandela was shot and killed in prison in 1980, despite him then going on to lead South Africa and actually dying in 2013.

It's a cultural meme that gets re-enforced over the years and a quirk of how easy our memories can be manipulated. It is not a glitch in the matrix or signs of an alien invasion. It's one of our many [[Perception Problems]] and a reason [[Everything is a Story]].

-   In [[The Actual-Inua Ellams]], he has a poem called *Fuck/The Mandela Effect*
-   Episode 10 Series 3 of The Parapod is a very funny exploration of this idea.
