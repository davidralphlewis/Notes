 from a physics point of view. I read it as I'm getting older and wondered what the hell time is anyway. I'm not sure I found out.

## Key Ideas

### Time is Relative

- It runs at different speeds at different places. Up a mountain, it is slower. In space, it is slower still. It is also affected by speed. The faster something moves the less time passes.
-   Mass slows time around it.
-   Sun and earth fall around each other due to time.
-   Gravity is time
-   Speed slows down time.

### The only Law of Physics that is Directional is Heat.

-   Always goes hot to cold, never the other way round.
-   Seeking equilibrium. Entropy.
-   Heat is the only distinction between past and future.

### Entropy is Relative

-   No distinction between cause and effect.
-   No shared present, multiple overlapping present times.
-   can overlap and circle back

### Time is a Field, Acted on by other Forces.

- Can stretch and change. 
- Time is granular, made up of Planck seconds- smallest divisible unit.
- Time exists in a superposition. Unsure of how it exists until it interacts with the world.
- Therefore the past, present and the future are indeterminate
