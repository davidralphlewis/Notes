 from the smallest atom to the largest planet. It argues that consciousness is not special but is an inherent part of matter. Also known as panpsychism.

> The panpsychist argues that consciousness did not emerge at some point during evolution. Rather, it's always associated with matter and vice versa â€“ they're two sides of the same coin. But the large majority of the mind associated with the various types of matter in our universe is extremely rudimentary. An electron or an atom, for example, enjoys just a tiny amount of consciousness. But as matter becomes more interconnected and rich, so does the mind, and vice versa, according to this way of thinking.
