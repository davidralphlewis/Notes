Humans like to see everything as a story, with a beginning middle and end. Or we tell a narrative from a particular perspective and minimise others. Our society is built on stories and most of them are incomplete, false, or give us an inflated sense of our own ego.

[[History is Always Edited]] for example, to fit whatever narrative is dominant. 

Another one of our [[perception-problems]].
