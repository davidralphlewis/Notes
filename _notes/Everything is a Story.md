Humans like to see everything as a story, with a beginning middle and end. Or we tell a narrative from a particular perspective and minimise others. Our society is built on stories and most of them are incomplete, false, or give us an inflated sense of our own ego.

[[History is Always Edited]] for example, to fit whatever narrative is dominant. 

Another one of our [[Perception Problems]].

> Let him describe what we have all seen so that it becomes a sequence. Bernard says there is always a story. I am a story. Louis is a story. There is the story of the boot-boy, the story of the man with one eye, the story of the woman who sells winkles.
