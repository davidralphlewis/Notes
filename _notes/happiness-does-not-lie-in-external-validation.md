One of the hardest lessons I've had to learn is [[do-not-create-art-for-the-validation-of-other-people]]. You need to create it for yourself, or for its own sake. 

The same is true of happiness more broadly. Other people's approval will not magically make you happy, nor will it help you in the long run. It will be a black hole that you constantly pour your energy into without necessarily getting anything back.

You need instead to know that [[peace-comes-from-within]], from your own thoughts. Only you can define your success.
