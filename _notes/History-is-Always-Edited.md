Because [[Everything-is-a-Story]] and [[History-is-Written-by-the-Winners]], it is always edited and cut down, especially in the West which believes in a monolithic story. (In opposition to the [[Aztec-View-of-History]] of history, for example.) We are always seeing an imperfect, edited version of events that happened.

> The problem isn't that history is edited and censored. In many ways the very purpose of history is to edit and censor, to manage the raw materials for the manufacture of myths that hold nations together. The problem is that a disturbing number of people don't seem to realise that our history has been edited and censored and don't realise that they can be part of that process.
