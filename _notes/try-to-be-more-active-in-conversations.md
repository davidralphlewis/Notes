In order to show the other person you are speaking with that you are engaging with them fully, be more active when speaking to people. 
It also helps you [[Be-Present]].

Give them your full attention ([[Attention-is-Everything]]), lean in and make eye contact. Don't be passive by looking at your phone or leaning away from them.

Its a simple tip but one we often forget.
