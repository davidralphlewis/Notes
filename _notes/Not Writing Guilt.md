It's easy to beat yourself up about not writing enough. You see others churning out novels while you struggle to find time to write a paragraph. As well as [[Writers Block]], you may be putting too much pressure on yourself.

It's part of [[Imposter Syndrome]]. Everyone goes through it. There's no right way to write, you don't have to be [[Writing-Every-Day]] or hit a word count to be a 'proper' writer.

Remind yourself that [[Art is Play]] and it can be fun.
