There's broadly two types of imagery- abstract and concrete.

Abstract is conceptual, so thing like love, victory, kindness- ideas that aren't necessarily grounded in the real world.

Concrete is things you can physically feel, touch and experience. So a rose is a concrete image when love isn't. (although maybe you can[[Twist-a-Clich√©]] by finding a new aspect of the rose.)

Concrete imagery tends to be better if you use more [[Specific-Detail]]. 

A good way to focus on the concrete is to use [[The-Five-Senses]]
