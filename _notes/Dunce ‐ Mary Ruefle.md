Poetry collection

- Strange images and metaphors uniting the poems in grief and aging. The collection explores the beauty of living, but also the inevitablity of death.
- A focus on the details of the natural world to illuminate a great melancholy, but also joy. 
- 
Turns of phrases like speech throughout, that are then twisted.
