# Red Sky Session 1- Mailika Booker

Notes from the first [[Red Sky Sessions]] run by <a href="https://applesandsnakes.org/" >Apples and Snakes</a>, a free series of writing workshops around poetry.

## Writing is all about habits and rituals.

-   Where do you write?
-   How do you maximise your time?
-   Try different spaces in house, different times.
-   No need to always be [[Writing-Every-Day]], but have a regular routine.

## If you aren't reading, you aren't writing.

-   Set reading goals.
-   Read as many poetry books as possible
-   Read a book in depth each month- underline and [[Make Marginalia]].
-   Why do you like certain poems?
-   What are they doing?
-   How does the imagery work?
-   Read anthologies to find poets.
-   Read outside your era and experience. ([[Read Widely]])

## Keep a [[Haiku]] journal

-   Encourages us to look for [[Specific Detail]].
-   Asks us to observe.

## Strategies to mess up the blank page

-   5/7 min [[Free Writing]].
-   Structured free writes- to a prompt or starting point.
-   Underline lines and pull out into a new poem
-   Start with simple contrasting statements- I know/ I don't know etc
-   Rhyme train for three minutes.
-   Line by line developments.
