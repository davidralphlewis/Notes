#BookNotes 

Very short, strange short stories/ prose poems. I first read Stanley Donward when I was doing my playwriting masters twelve years ago. Reading him again, it's amazing how much I have been influenced by these singular stories and how much I have tried to emulate them in my own work.

-   Collection of short stories/ [[Prose Poem]] that have the vividness and strangeness of nightmares. (A great example of [[Writing From the Subconscious]].)
-   All present tense and first person, giving an uneasiness to the odd situations.
-   Sometimes darkly funny, sometimes despairing.
