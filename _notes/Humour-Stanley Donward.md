#BookNotes 
-   Collection of short stories/ [[Prose Poem]] that have the vividness and strangeness of nightmares. (A great example of [[Writing from the subconscious]].)
-   All present tense and first person, giving an uneasiness to the odd situations.
-   Sometimes darkly funny, sometimes despairing.
