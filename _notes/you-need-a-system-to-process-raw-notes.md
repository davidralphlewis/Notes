[[Meta-Notes]]

You should regularly review your raw notes and [[revise-your-notes-towards-action]]. It is important to have a system to do this regularly as [[notes-should-have-an-end-product]].

This is the same idea as the [[Weekly-Review]] in [[Getting-Things-Done]]- examine what you have been thinking about and then take action. [[Writing-is-a-way-of-externalising-our-thoughts]] and we can then process it. 

I go through my [[Bullet-journal]] weekly and monthly.
