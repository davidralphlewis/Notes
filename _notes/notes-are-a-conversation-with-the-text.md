You should always [[Make-Marginalia]], because it's a way to engage in [[Active-Reading]]. Or make notes seperately. Either way, you are engaging in a conversation between you in the present day and the author of the text, possibly thousands of years in the past. 

In this way, you can engage with the ideas more fully.
