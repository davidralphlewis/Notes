One way to create new work is take something someone else has created and change it in some way. Crucially, you can't just take an existing piece of work and call it your own, you need to make substantive changes - adding or subtracting or transforming it.

Some ways to create something new from others are:

- [[Erasure-Poetry]]
- [[After-poem]]
- [[Cut-Up-Technique]]
- [[Golden-Shovel]]
