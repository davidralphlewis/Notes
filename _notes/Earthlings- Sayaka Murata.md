## *Earthlings*- Sayaka Murata

This caught me completely by surprise. It's a book that goes in some very extreme directions that I was not expecting at all, especially given the initial careful banality of detail and social observation. This is a book that explores alienation and dehumanisation, that sneaks up on you with it's violence and intensity. To say any more would ruin the impact this novel can have.
