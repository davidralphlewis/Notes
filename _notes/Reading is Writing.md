## *Rebecca* - Daphne Du Maurier

How has it taken me this long to read *Rebecca?* I've long been aware of it as a classic but never actually got round to reading it. Well, more fool me. *Rebecca* is strange and cruel, with sentences that unfold in your mind with the power of a dream. It's tightly paced and still shocking after all these years. It also finishes in the perfect place, not so much a cliff hanger but more leaving you right in a singular moment of horror.
