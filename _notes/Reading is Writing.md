Maybe, if you have [[Writers Block]], it isn't a case of out put it is a case of not watching your input.  Reading is writing because you are still exercising that language part of your brain. It's important to read critically, [[Make Marginalia]] and in this way you can [[Control your Input for Better Output]].

So maybe stop writing and start reading instead.
