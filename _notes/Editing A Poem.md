Here are some ideas and techniques if you are stuck on rewriting a poem.

Remember that the whole point of editing is to edit through someone else's eyes. You need to not be in love with the poem.  Use [[Time as an editor]].  

Also remember [[all art is subjective￼￼and [[Each poem Is New]]. [[Focus on Process not the end goal]]

-   [[Read-Writing-Aloud]] to hear the sound of it.
-   Where does the poem surprise you? Make these accidents intentional. Build up to them or go in different directions.
-   What is the imagery doing? Is it coherent? Is it mostly [[Concrete or abstract]]? Are you following [[show-dont-tell]]? Should you?
-   Does the form reflect the content? Look at other [[Poetic Forms]] to find one that might work. Can you build in rhyme or is the rhyme inappropriate?
-   Look at line breaks. What are they doing? Are they intentional?
-   Remove clichés (or deliberately [[Twist a Cliché]])
-   Remove joints of poem and common words.
-   Keep a [[The-Spark-File]]
-   [[Cut the Last Lines]]

## Transform the poem and create something new out of the ashes.

-   Use a line as a new poem
-   Create a [[negative poem]]
-   Combine three images from separate poems or separate sources.
-   Condense to a single sentence
-   [[Cut Up Technique]] - shred the poem
-   [[n7]]
-   Use [[text-manipulation-tools]] to outsource the process to machines.
