Mass, large scale of automation is often claimed to be AI or machines but a lot of the time it is hours of miserable, difficult labour. This is the 'mechanical turk' principle, where a chess playing automaton turned put to be controlled by people.

A good example is content moderation on Facebook, which is done by teams earning very little instead of by machine. Or Thomas Jefferson's house  which appear automated but was built on the labour of slaves. ([[Behind-the-bastards]])
