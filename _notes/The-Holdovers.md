[[film-notes]]

Perfectly pitched three hander about people staying in a posh school over the winter break. 

The characters have layers and complications, and the acting is amazing. It really sells the characters. Like Alexander Payne's [[Sideways]], its a film about misanthropes that is actually deeply empathetic. Paul Giamatti's character (Paul Hunham) is miserable, not because he hates the world but he empathises with the downtrodden and sees injustice everywhere, which has hardened his heart. The film is a plea to [[Be-Kind]] to everyone, no matter the circumstance.
