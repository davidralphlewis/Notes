Way better than it had any right to be, this film about a toy set skewers the idea of the patriarchy whilst being very funny throughout. The production is great, as is the songs. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are perfectly cast. 

[Maggie Mae Fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNsTOQGjP-U) argues the film's close ties with Stanley Kubrick inform a feminine component against Stanley Kubrick's aggressive masculinity.
