This is a refrain in [[The-bullet-journal-method-by-Ryder-Carroll-2018]], which is useful to help you [[Choose-What-is-Important]]. You can use it for specific tools or tasks, and will help you understand why you are doing a certain thing. Is it useful? Do I still need it? 

Useful in combination with [[Ask-why-five-times]] as a [[Journaling]] prompt.
