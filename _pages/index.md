# Incomplete thoughts, rambles, ideas and notes

This is the place where I keep useful notes and other miscellaneous snippets. It's a digital garden, a place where ideas compost. Ideas are half sketched or incomplete. It's a constantly evolving notebook, powered by Obisidian. Things might be wrong or inaccurate. Email me to let me know if anything's really incorrect.

My main site and blog is [here](https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk) if you want something a bit more coherent.

Currently there are **231** notes within this garden
