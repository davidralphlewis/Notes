# Incomplete thoughts, rambles, ideas and notes

This is the place where I keep useful notes and other miscellaneous snippets. It's a digital garden, a place where ideas compost. Ideas are half sketched or incomplete. It's a constantly evolving notebook, powered by Obisidian. Things might be wrong or inaccurate. Email me to let me know if anything's really incorrect.

My main site and blog is [here](https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk) if you want something a bit more coherent.

Currently there are **308** notes within this garden

<ul>

 {% assign recent_notes = site.notes | sort: "last_modified_at_timestamp" | reverse %}
 {% for note in recent_notes | limit: 5 %}
<li>
{{ note.last_modified_at | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }} â€” <a class="internal-link" href="{{ note.url }}">{{ note.title }}</a>
</li>
{% endfor %}

</ul>
